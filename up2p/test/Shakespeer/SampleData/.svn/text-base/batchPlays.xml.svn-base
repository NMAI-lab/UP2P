<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Before LEONATO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</LINE>
<LINE>comes this night to Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</LINE>
<LINE>when I left him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But few of any sort, and none of name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</LINE>
<LINE>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</LINE>
<LINE>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</LINE>
<LINE>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</LINE>
<LINE>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</LINE>
<LINE>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</LINE>
<LINE>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</LINE>
<LINE>tell you how.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</LINE>
<LINE>glad of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have already delivered him letters, and there</LINE>
<LINE>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</LINE>
<LINE>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</LINE>
<LINE>bitterness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he break out into tears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In great measure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</LINE>
<LINE>truer than those that are so washed. How much</LINE>
<LINE>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</LINE>
<LINE>wars or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</LINE>
<LINE>in the army of any sort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he that you ask for, niece?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</LINE>
<LINE>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</LINE>
<LINE>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</LINE>
<LINE>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</LINE>
<LINE>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</LINE>
<LINE>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</LINE>
<LINE>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</LINE>
<LINE>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</LINE>
<LINE>excellent stomach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a good soldier too, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</LINE>
<LINE>honourable virtues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</LINE>
<LINE>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</LINE>
<LINE>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</LINE>
<LINE>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</LINE>
<LINE>between them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</LINE>
<LINE>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</LINE>
<LINE>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</LINE>
<LINE>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</LINE>
<LINE>bear it for a difference between himself and his</LINE>
<LINE>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</LINE>
<LINE>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</LINE>
<LINE>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</LINE>
<LINE>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</LINE>
<LINE>next block.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</LINE>
<LINE>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</LINE>
<LINE>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</LINE>
<LINE>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</LINE>
<LINE>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</LINE>
<LINE>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</LINE>
<LINE>thousand pound ere a' be cured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will hold friends with you, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, good friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will never run mad, niece.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not till a hot January.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Don Pedro is approached.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
and BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</LINE>
<LINE>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</LINE>
<LINE>cost, and you encounter it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</LINE>
<LINE>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</LINE>
<LINE>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</LINE>
<LINE>and happiness takes his leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</LINE>
<LINE>is your daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her mother hath many times told me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</LINE>
<LINE>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</LINE>
<LINE>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</LINE>
<LINE>honourable father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</LINE>
<LINE>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as</LINE>
<LINE>like him as she is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</LINE>
<LINE>Benedick: nobody marks you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</LINE>
<LINE>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</LINE>
<LINE>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</LINE>
<LINE>in her presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</LINE>
<LINE>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</LINE>
<LINE>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</LINE>
<LINE>heart; for, truly, I love none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</LINE>
<LINE>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</LINE>
<LINE>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</LINE>
<LINE>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</LINE>
<LINE>swear he loves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate</LINE>
<LINE>scratched face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such</LINE>
<LINE>a face as yours were.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</LINE>
<LINE>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's</LINE>
<LINE>name; I have done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio</LINE>
<LINE>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath</LINE>
<LINE>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at</LINE>
<LINE>the least a month; and he heartily prays some</LINE>
<LINE>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no</LINE>
<LINE>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To DON JOHN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</LINE>
<LINE>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please it your grace lead on?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I noted her not; but I looked on her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she not a modest young lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</LINE>
<LINE>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak</LINE>
<LINE>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</LINE>
<LINE>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</LINE>
<LINE>for a great praise: only this commendation I can</LINE>
<LINE>afford her, that were she other than she is, she</LINE>
<LINE>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I</LINE>
<LINE>do not like her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</LINE>
<LINE>truly how thou likest her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can the world buy such a jewel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this</LINE>
<LINE>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,</LINE>
<LINE>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a</LINE>
<LINE>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take</LINE>
<LINE>you, to go in the song?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I</LINE>
<LINE>looked on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such</LINE>
<LINE>matter: there's her cousin, an she were not</LINE>
<LINE>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty</LINE>
<LINE>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I</LINE>
<LINE>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the</LINE>
<LINE>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world</LINE>
<LINE>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?</LINE>
<LINE>Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck</LINE>
<LINE>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away</LINE>
<LINE>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter DON PEDRO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What secret hath held you here, that you followed</LINE>
<LINE>not to Leonato's?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I charge thee on thy allegiance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb</LINE>
<LINE>man; I would have you think so; but, on my</LINE>
<LINE>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is</LINE>
<LINE>in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.</LINE>
<LINE>Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's</LINE>
<LINE>short daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If this were so, so were it uttered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor</LINE>
<LINE>'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be</LINE>
<LINE>so.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it</LINE>
<LINE>should be otherwise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I speak my thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I love her, I feel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she is worthy, I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor</LINE>
<LINE>know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that</LINE>
<LINE>fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite</LINE>
<LINE>of beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And never could maintain his part but in the force</LINE>
<LINE>of his will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she</LINE>
<LINE>brought me up, I likewise give her most humble</LINE>
<LINE>thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my</LINE>
<LINE>forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,</LINE>
<LINE>all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do</LINE>
<LINE>them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the</LINE>
<LINE>right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which</LINE>
<LINE>I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood</LINE>
<LINE>with love than I will get again with drinking, pick</LINE>
<LINE>out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me</LINE>
<LINE>up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of</LINE>
<LINE>blind Cupid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt prove a notable argument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot</LINE>
<LINE>at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on</LINE>
<LINE>the shoulder, and called Adam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull</LINE>
<LINE>doth bear the yoke.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible</LINE>
<LINE>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set</LINE>
<LINE>them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,</LINE>
<LINE>and in such great letters as they write 'Here is</LINE>
<LINE>good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign</LINE>
<LINE>'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in</LINE>
<LINE>Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I look for an earthquake too, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you temporize with the hours. In the</LINE>
<LINE>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to</LINE>
<LINE>Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will</LINE>
<LINE>not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made</LINE>
<LINE>great preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have almost matter enough in me for such an</LINE>
<LINE>embassage; and so I commit you--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your</LINE>
<LINE>discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and</LINE>
<LINE>the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere</LINE>
<LINE>you flout old ends any further, examine your</LINE>
<LINE>conscience: and so I leave you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, your highness now may do me good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</LINE>
<LINE>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No child but Hero; she's his only heir.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>When you went onward on this ended action,</LINE>
<LINE>I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand</LINE>
<LINE>Than to drive liking to the name of love:</LINE>
<LINE>But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</LINE>
<LINE>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</LINE>
<LINE>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</LINE>
<LINE>Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wilt be like a lover presently</LINE>
<LINE>And tire the hearer with a book of words.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will break with her and with her father,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end</LINE>
<LINE>That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How sweetly you do minister to love,</LINE>
<LINE>That know love's grief by his complexion!</LINE>
<LINE>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest grant is the necessity.</LINE>
<LINE>Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will fit thee with the remedy.</LINE>
<LINE>I know we shall have revelling to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>I will assume thy part in some disguise</LINE>
<LINE>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart</LINE>
<LINE>And take her hearing prisoner with the force</LINE>
<LINE>And strong encounter of my amorous tale:</LINE>
<LINE>Then after to her father will I break;</LINE>
<LINE>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</LINE>
<LINE>In practise let us put it presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A room in LEONATO's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?</LINE>
<LINE>hath he provided this music?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell</LINE>
<LINE>you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the event stamps them: but they have a good</LINE>
<LINE>cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count</LINE>
<LINE>Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine</LINE>
<LINE>orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:</LINE>
<LINE>the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my</LINE>
<LINE>niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it</LINE>
<LINE>this night in a dance: and if he found her</LINE>
<LINE>accordant, he meant to take the present time by the</LINE>
<LINE>top and instantly break with you of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and</LINE>
<LINE>question him yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear</LINE>
<LINE>itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,</LINE>
<LINE>that she may be the better prepared for an answer,</LINE>
<LINE>if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you</LINE>
<LINE>mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your</LINE>
<LINE>skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  The same.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out</LINE>
<LINE>of measure sad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;</LINE>
<LINE>therefore the sadness is without limit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should hear reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If not a present remedy, at least a patient</LINE>
<LINE>sufferance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral</LINE>
<LINE>medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide</LINE>
<LINE>what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile</LINE>
<LINE>at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait</LINE>
<LINE>for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and</LINE>
<LINE>tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and</LINE>
<LINE>claw no man in his humour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this</LINE>
<LINE>till you may do it without controlment. You have of</LINE>
<LINE>late stood out against your brother, and he hath</LINE>
<LINE>ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is</LINE>
<LINE>impossible you should take true root but by the</LINE>
<LINE>fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful</LINE>
<LINE>that you frame the season for your own harvest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in</LINE>
<LINE>his grace, and it better fits my blood to be</LINE>
<LINE>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob</LINE>
<LINE>love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to</LINE>
<LINE>be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied</LINE>
<LINE>but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with</LINE>
<LINE>a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I</LINE>
<LINE>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my</LINE>
<LINE>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do</LINE>
<LINE>my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and</LINE>
<LINE>seek not to alter me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you make no use of your discontent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make all use of it, for I use it only.</LINE>
<LINE>Who comes here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BORACHIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What news, Borachio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your</LINE>
<LINE>brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I</LINE>
<LINE>can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?</LINE>
<LINE>What is he for a fool that betroths himself to</LINE>
<LINE>unquietness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, it is your brother's right hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who? the most exquisite Claudio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks</LINE>
<LINE>he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a</LINE>
<LINE>musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand</LINE>
<LINE>in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the</LINE>
<LINE>arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the</LINE>
<LINE>prince should woo Hero for himself, and having</LINE>
<LINE>obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to</LINE>
<LINE>my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the</LINE>
<LINE>glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I</LINE>
<LINE>bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the death, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the</LINE>
<LINE>greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of</LINE>
<LINE>my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll wait upon your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

</ACT>

<ACT><TITLE>ACT II</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  A hall in LEONATO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was not Count John here at supper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw him not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see</LINE>
<LINE>him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He were an excellent man that were made just in the</LINE>
<LINE>midway between him and Benedick: the one is too</LINE>
<LINE>like an image and says nothing, and the other too</LINE>
<LINE>like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's</LINE>
<LINE>mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior</LINE>
<LINE>Benedick's face,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money</LINE>
<LINE>enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman</LINE>
<LINE>in the world, if a' could get her good-will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a</LINE>
<LINE>husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, she's too curst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's</LINE>
<LINE>sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst</LINE>
<LINE>cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which</LINE>
<LINE>blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and</LINE>
<LINE>evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a</LINE>
<LINE>beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel</LINE>
<LINE>and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a</LINE>
<LINE>beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no</LINE>
<LINE>beard is less than a man: and he that is more than</LINE>
<LINE>a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a</LINE>
<LINE>man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take</LINE>
<LINE>sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his</LINE>
<LINE>apes into hell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, then, go you into hell?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet</LINE>
<LINE>me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and</LINE>
<LINE>say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to</LINE>
<LINE>heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver</LINE>
<LINE>I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the</LINE>
<LINE>heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and</LINE>
<LINE>there live we as merry as the day is long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To HERO</STAGEDIR>  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled</LINE>
<LINE>by your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy</LINE>
<LINE>and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all</LINE>
<LINE>that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else</LINE>
<LINE>make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please</LINE>
<LINE>me.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till God make men of some other metal than</LINE>
<LINE>earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be</LINE>
<LINE>overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make</LINE>
<LINE>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?</LINE>
<LINE>No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;</LINE>
<LINE>and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince</LINE>
<LINE>do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be</LINE>
<LINE>not wooed in good time: if the prince be too</LINE>
<LINE>important, tell him there is measure in every thing</LINE>
<LINE>and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:</LINE>
<LINE>wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,</LINE>
<LINE>a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot</LINE>
<LINE>and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as</LINE>
<LINE>fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a</LINE>
<LINE>measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes</LINE>
<LINE>repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the</LINE>
<LINE>cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>All put on their masks</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR,
DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With me in your company?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may say so, when I please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when please you to say so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I like your favour; for God defend the lute</LINE>
<LINE>should be like the case!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, your visor should be thatched.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak low, if you speak love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Drawing her aside</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I would you did like me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many</LINE>
<LINE>ill-qualities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which is one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say my prayers aloud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God match me with a good dancer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is</LINE>
<LINE>done! Answer, clerk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more words: the clerk is answered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At a word, I am not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you by the waggling of your head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To tell you true, I counterfeit him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were</LINE>
<LINE>the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you</LINE>
<LINE>are he, you are he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At a word, I am not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your</LINE>
<LINE>excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,</LINE>
<LINE>mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an</LINE>
<LINE>end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you not tell me who told you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, you shall pardon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor will you not tell me who you are?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit</LINE>
<LINE>out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Benedick that said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure you know him well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he never make you laugh?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, what is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;</LINE>
<LINE>only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:</LINE>
<LINE>none but libertines delight in him; and the</LINE>
<LINE>commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;</LINE>
<LINE>for he both pleases men and angers them, and then</LINE>
<LINE>they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in</LINE>
<LINE>the fleet: I would he had boarded me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;</LINE>
<LINE>which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,</LINE>
<LINE>strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a</LINE>
<LINE>partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no</LINE>
<LINE>supper that night.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We must follow the leaders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In every good thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at</LINE>
<LINE>the next turning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,
and CLAUDIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath</LINE>
<LINE>withdrawn her father to break with him about it.</LINE>
<LINE>The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are not you Signior Benedick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know me well; I am he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:</LINE>
<LINE>he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him</LINE>
<LINE>from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may</LINE>
<LINE>do the part of an honest man in it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How know you he loves her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard him swear his affection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let us to the banquet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Friendship is constant in all other things</LINE>
<LINE>Save in the office and affairs of love:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;</LINE>
<LINE>Let every eye negotiate for itself</LINE>
<LINE>And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch</LINE>
<LINE>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.</LINE>
<LINE>This is an accident of hourly proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BENEDICK</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Yea, the same.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, will you go with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even to the next willow, about your own business,</LINE>
<LINE>county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?</LINE>
<LINE>about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under</LINE>
<LINE>your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear</LINE>
<LINE>it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish him joy of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they</LINE>
<LINE>sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would</LINE>
<LINE>have served you thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, leave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.</LINE>
<LINE>But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not</LINE>
<LINE>know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go</LINE>
<LINE>under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I</LINE>
<LINE>am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it</LINE>
<LINE>is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice</LINE>
<LINE>that puts the world into her person and so gives me</LINE>
<LINE>out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.</LINE>
<LINE>I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a</LINE>
<LINE>warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,</LINE>
<LINE>that your grace had got the good will of this young</LINE>
<LINE>lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,</LINE>
<LINE>either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or</LINE>
<LINE>to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be whipped! What's his fault?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being</LINE>
<LINE>overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his</LINE>
<LINE>companion, and he steals it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The</LINE>
<LINE>transgression is in the stealer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,</LINE>
<LINE>and the garland too; for the garland he might have</LINE>
<LINE>worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on</LINE>
<LINE>you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to</LINE>
<LINE>the owner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,</LINE>
<LINE>you say honestly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman that danced with her told her she is much</LINE>
<LINE>wronged by you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!</LINE>
<LINE>an oak but with one green leaf on it would have</LINE>
<LINE>answered her; my very visor began to assume life and</LINE>
<LINE>scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been</LINE>
<LINE>myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was</LINE>
<LINE>duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest</LINE>
<LINE>with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood</LINE>
<LINE>like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at</LINE>
<LINE>me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:</LINE>
<LINE>if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,</LINE>
<LINE>there were no living near her; she would infect to</LINE>
<LINE>the north star. I would not marry her, though she</LINE>
<LINE>were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before</LINE>
<LINE>he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have</LINE>
<LINE>turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make</LINE>
<LINE>the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God</LINE>
<LINE>some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while</LINE>
<LINE>she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a</LINE>
<LINE>sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they</LINE>
<LINE>would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror</LINE>
<LINE>and perturbation follows her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will your grace command me any service to the</LINE>
<LINE>world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now</LINE>
<LINE>to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;</LINE>
<LINE>I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the</LINE>
<LINE>furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of</LINE>
<LINE>Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great</LINE>
<LINE>Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,</LINE>
<LINE>rather than hold three words' conference with this</LINE>
<LINE>harpy. You have no employment for me?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, but to desire your good company.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave</LINE>
<LINE>him use for it, a double heart for his single one:</LINE>
<LINE>marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,</LINE>
<LINE>therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I</LINE>
<LINE>should prove the mother of fools. I have brought</LINE>
<LINE>Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not sad, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How then? sick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor</LINE>
<LINE>well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and</LINE>
<LINE>something of that jealous complexion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;</LINE>
<LINE>though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is</LINE>
<LINE>false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and</LINE>
<LINE>fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,</LINE>
<LINE>and his good will obtained: name the day of</LINE>
<LINE>marriage, and God give thee joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my</LINE>
<LINE>fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an</LINE>
<LINE>grace say Amen to it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, count, 'tis your cue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were</LINE>
<LINE>but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as</LINE>
<LINE>you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for</LINE>
<LINE>you and dote upon the exchange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth</LINE>
<LINE>with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on</LINE>
<LINE>the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his</LINE>
<LINE>ear that he is in her heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so she doth, cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the</LINE>
<LINE>world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a</LINE>
<LINE>corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would rather have one of your father's getting.</LINE>
<LINE>Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your</LINE>
<LINE>father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you have me, lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, unless I might have another for</LINE>
<LINE>working-days: your grace is too costly to wear</LINE>
<LINE>every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I</LINE>
<LINE>was born to speak all mirth and no matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best</LINE>
<LINE>becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in</LINE>
<LINE>a merry hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there</LINE>
<LINE>was a star danced, and under that was I born.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousins, God give you joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's little of the melancholy element in her, my</LINE>
<LINE>lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and</LINE>
<LINE>not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,</LINE>
<LINE>she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked</LINE>
<LINE>herself with laughing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She were an excellent wife for Benedict.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,</LINE>
<LINE>they would talk themselves mad.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love</LINE>
<LINE>have all his rites.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just</LINE>
<LINE>seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all</LINE>
<LINE>things answer my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:</LINE>
<LINE>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go</LINE>
<LINE>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of</LINE>
<LINE>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior</LINE>
<LINE>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of</LINE>
<LINE>affection the one with the other. I would fain have</LINE>
<LINE>it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if</LINE>
<LINE>you three will but minister such assistance as I</LINE>
<LINE>shall give you direction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten</LINE>
<LINE>nights' watchings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you too, gentle Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my</LINE>
<LINE>cousin to a good husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that</LINE>
<LINE>I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble</LINE>
<LINE>strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I</LINE>
<LINE>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she</LINE>
<LINE>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your</LINE>
<LINE>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in</LINE>
<LINE>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he</LINE>
<LINE>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,</LINE>
<LINE>Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be</LINE>
<LINE>ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,</LINE>
<LINE>and I will tell you my drift.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the</LINE>
<LINE>daughter of Leonato.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be</LINE>
<LINE>medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,</LINE>
<LINE>and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges</LINE>
<LINE>evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no</LINE>
<LINE>dishonesty shall appear in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me briefly how.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I told your lordship a year since, how much</LINE>
<LINE>I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting</LINE>
<LINE>gentlewoman to Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I remember.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to</LINE>
<LINE>the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that</LINE>
<LINE>he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned</LINE>
<LINE>Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold</LINE>
<LINE>up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What proof shall I make of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,</LINE>
<LINE>to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any</LINE>
<LINE>other issue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and</LINE>
<LINE>the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know</LINE>
<LINE>that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the</LINE>
<LINE>prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's</LINE>
<LINE>honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's</LINE>
<LINE>reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the</LINE>
<LINE>semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered</LINE>
<LINE>thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:</LINE>
<LINE>offer them instances; which shall bear no less</LINE>
<LINE>likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,</LINE>
<LINE>hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me</LINE>
<LINE>Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night</LINE>
<LINE>before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I</LINE>
<LINE>will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be</LINE>
<LINE>absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth</LINE>
<LINE>of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called</LINE>
<LINE>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put</LINE>
<LINE>it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and</LINE>
<LINE>thy fee is a thousand ducats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning</LINE>
<LINE>shall not shame me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither</LINE>
<LINE>to me in the orchard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am here already, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Boy</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</LINE>
<LINE>another man is a fool when he dedicates his</LINE>
<LINE>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</LINE>
<LINE>such shallow follies in others, become the argument</LINE>
<LINE>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</LINE>
<LINE>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</LINE>
<LINE>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</LINE>
<LINE>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</LINE>
<LINE>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</LINE>
<LINE>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</LINE>
<LINE>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</LINE>
<LINE>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</LINE>
<LINE>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</LINE>
<LINE>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</LINE>
<LINE>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</LINE>
<LINE>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</LINE>
<LINE>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but</LINE>
<LINE>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</LINE>
<LINE>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</LINE>
<LINE>is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am</LINE>
<LINE>well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</LINE>
<LINE>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in</LINE>
<LINE>my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,</LINE>
<LINE>or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;</LINE>
<LINE>fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not</LINE>
<LINE>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</LINE>
<LINE>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</LINE>
<LINE>be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and</LINE>
<LINE>Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</LINE>

<LINE>all's done.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The Song</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Men were deceivers ever,</LINE>
<LINE>One foot in sea and one on shore,</LINE>
<LINE>To one thing constant never:</LINE>
<LINE>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</LINE>
<LINE>And be you blithe and bonny,</LINE>
<LINE>Converting all your sounds of woe</LINE>
<LINE>Into Hey nonny, nonny.</LINE>
<LINE>Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,</LINE>
<LINE>Of dumps so dull and heavy;</LINE>
<LINE>The fraud of men was ever so,</LINE>
<LINE>Since summer first was leafy:</LINE>
<LINE>Then sigh not so, &amp;c.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, a good song.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And an ill singer, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,</LINE>
<LINE>they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad</LINE>
<LINE>voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the</LINE>
<LINE>night-raven, come what plague could have come after</LINE>
<LINE>it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,</LINE>
<LINE>get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we</LINE>
<LINE>would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best I can, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so: farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</LINE>
<LINE>to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Benedick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did</LINE>
<LINE>never think that lady would have loved any man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she</LINE>
<LINE>should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in</LINE>
<LINE>all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think</LINE>
<LINE>of it but that she loves him with an enraged</LINE>
<LINE>affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May be she doth but counterfeit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, like enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</LINE>
<LINE>passion came so near the life of passion as she</LINE>
<LINE>discovers it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what effects of passion shows she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</LINE>
<LINE>my daughter tell you how.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</LINE>
<LINE>thought her spirit had been invincible against all</LINE>
<LINE>assaults of affection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</LINE>
<LINE>against Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should think this a gull, but that the</LINE>
<LINE>white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>sure, hide himself in such reverence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall</LINE>
<LINE>I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him</LINE>
<LINE>with scorn, write to him that I love him?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This says she now when she is beginning to write to</LINE>
<LINE>him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and</LINE>
<LINE>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</LINE>
<LINE>sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</LINE>
<LINE>pretty jest your daughter told us of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</LINE>
<LINE>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</LINE>
<LINE>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</LINE>
<LINE>to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I</LINE>
<LINE>measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I</LINE>
<LINE>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</LINE>
<LINE>love him, I should.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</LINE>
<LINE>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O</LINE>
<LINE>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</LINE>
<LINE>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</LINE>
<LINE>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</LINE>
<LINE>to herself: it is very true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</LINE>
<LINE>other, if she will not discover it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</LINE>
<LINE>torment the poor lady worse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an</LINE>
<LINE>excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,</LINE>
<LINE>she is virtuous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And she is exceeding wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</LINE>
<LINE>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</LINE>
<LINE>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</LINE>
<LINE>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</LINE>
<LINE>have daffed all other respects and made her half</LINE>
<LINE>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</LINE>
<LINE>what a' will say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it good, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</LINE>
<LINE>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</LINE>
<LINE>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</LINE>
<LINE>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</LINE>
<LINE>accustomed crossness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She doth well: if she should make tender of her</LINE>
<LINE>love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the</LINE>
<LINE>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a very proper man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I take him to be valiant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</LINE>
<LINE>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</LINE>
<LINE>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</LINE>
<LINE>them with a most Christian-like fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:</LINE>
<LINE>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</LINE>
<LINE>quarrel with fear and trembling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</LINE>
<LINE>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</LINE>
<LINE>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</LINE>
<LINE>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</LINE>
<LINE>good counsel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</LINE>
<LINE>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</LINE>
<LINE>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never</LINE>
<LINE>trust my expectation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</LINE>
<LINE>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The</LINE>
<LINE>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of</LINE>
<LINE>another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the</LINE>
<LINE>scene that I would see, which will be merely a</LINE>
<LINE>dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Coming forward</STAGEDIR>  This can be no trick: the</LINE>
<LINE>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</LINE>
<LINE>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</LINE>
<LINE>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</LINE>
<LINE>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</LINE>
<LINE>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>the love come from her; they say too that she will</LINE>
<LINE>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</LINE>
<LINE>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</LINE>
<LINE>are they that hear their detractions and can put</LINE>
<LINE>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a</LINE>
<LINE>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</LINE>
<LINE>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</LINE>
<LINE>no great argument of her folly, for I will be</LINE>
<LINE>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</LINE>
<LINE>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</LINE>
<LINE>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</LINE>
<LINE>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</LINE>
<LINE>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</LINE>
<LINE>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</LINE>
<LINE>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would</LINE>
<LINE>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I</LINE>
<LINE>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!</LINE>
<LINE>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in</LINE>
<LINE>her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BEATRICE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take</LINE>
<LINE>pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would</LINE>
<LINE>not have come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You take pleasure then in the message?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's</LINE>
<LINE>point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,</LINE>
<LINE>signior: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in</LINE>
<LINE>to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took</LINE>
<LINE>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains</LINE>
<LINE>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains</LINE>
<LINE>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do</LINE>
<LINE>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not</LINE>
<LINE>love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;</LINE>
<LINE>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</LINE>
<LINE>Proposing with the prince and Claudio:</LINE>
<LINE>Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula</LINE>
<LINE>Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse</LINE>
<LINE>Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her steal into the pleached bower,</LINE>
<LINE>Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,</LINE>
<LINE>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</LINE>
<LINE>Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,</LINE>
<LINE>To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</LINE>
<LINE>As we do trace this alley up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>Our talk must only be of Benedick.</LINE>
<LINE>When I do name him, let it be thy part</LINE>
<LINE>To praise him more than ever man did merit:</LINE>
<LINE>My talk to thee must be how Benedick</LINE>
<LINE>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter</LINE>
<LINE>Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,</LINE>
<LINE>That only wounds by hearsay.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BEATRICE, behind</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now begin;</LINE>
<LINE>For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs</LINE>
<LINE>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish</LINE>
<LINE>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,</LINE>
<LINE>And greedily devour the treacherous bait:</LINE>
<LINE>So angle we for Beatrice; who even now</LINE>
<LINE>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.</LINE>
<LINE>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Approaching the bower</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;</LINE>
<LINE>I know her spirits are as coy and wild</LINE>
<LINE>As haggerds of the rock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But are you sure</LINE>
<LINE>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;</LINE>
<LINE>But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>To wish him wrestle with affection,</LINE>
<LINE>And never to let Beatrice know of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</LINE>
<LINE>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</LINE>
<LINE>As much as may be yielded to a man:</LINE>
<LINE>But Nature never framed a woman's heart</LINE>
<LINE>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;</LINE>
<LINE>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Misprising what they look on, and her wit</LINE>
<LINE>Values itself so highly that to her</LINE>
<LINE>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</LINE>
<LINE>She is so self-endeared.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, I think so;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore certainly it were not good</LINE>
<LINE>She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</LINE>
<LINE>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,</LINE>
<LINE>But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,</LINE>
<LINE>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</LINE>
<LINE>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,</LINE>
<LINE>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</LINE>
<LINE>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</LINE>
<LINE>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</LINE>
<LINE>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</LINE>
<LINE>So turns she every man the wrong side out</LINE>
<LINE>And never gives to truth and virtue that</LINE>
<LINE>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</LINE>
<LINE>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:</LINE>
<LINE>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</LINE>
<LINE>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</LINE>
<LINE>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:</LINE>
<LINE>It were a better death than die with mocks,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; rather I will go to Benedick</LINE>
<LINE>And counsel him to fight against his passion.</LINE>
<LINE>And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders</LINE>
<LINE>To stain my cousin with: one doth not know</LINE>
<LINE>How much an ill word may empoison liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.</LINE>
<LINE>She cannot be so much without true judgment--</LINE>
<LINE>Having so swift and excellent a wit</LINE>
<LINE>As she is prized to have--as to refuse</LINE>
<LINE>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is the only man of Italy.</LINE>
<LINE>Always excepted my dear Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,</LINE>
<LINE>Goes foremost in report through Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.</LINE>
<LINE>When are you married, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.</LINE>

<LINE>Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?</LINE>
<LINE>Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!</LINE>
<LINE>No glory lives behind the back of such.</LINE>
<LINE>And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee</LINE>
<LINE>To bind our loves up in a holy band;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss</LINE>

<LINE>with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown</LINE>

<LINE>mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's</LINE>
<LINE>bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at</LINE>
<LINE>him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his</LINE>
<LINE>tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his</LINE>
<LINE>tongue speaks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gallants, I am not as I have been.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So say I methinks you are sadder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope he be in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in</LINE>
<LINE>him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,</LINE>
<LINE>he wants money.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have the toothache.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Draw it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! sigh for the toothache?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is but a humour or a worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, every one can master a grief but he that has</LINE>
<LINE>it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet say I, he is in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be</LINE>
<LINE>a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be</LINE>
<LINE>a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the</LINE>
<LINE>shape of two countries at once, as, a German from</LINE>
<LINE>the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from</LINE>
<LINE>the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy</LINE>
<LINE>to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no</LINE>
<LINE>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no</LINE>
<LINE>believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'</LINE>
<LINE>mornings; what should that bode?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath any man seen him at the barber's?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,</LINE>
<LINE>and the old ornament of his cheek hath already</LINE>
<LINE>stuffed tennis-balls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him</LINE>
<LINE>out by that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The greatest note of it is his melancholy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when was he wont to wash his face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear</LINE>
<LINE>what they say of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into</LINE>
<LINE>a lute-string and now governed by stops.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,</LINE>
<LINE>conclude he is in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but I know who loves him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of</LINE>
<LINE>all, dies for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall be buried with her face upwards.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old</LINE>
<LINE>signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight</LINE>
<LINE>or nine wise words to speak to you, which these</LINE>
<LINE>hobby-horses must not hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this</LINE>
<LINE>played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two</LINE>
<LINE>bears will not bite one another when they meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DON JOHN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord and brother, God save you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good den, brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If your leisure served, I would speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In private?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for</LINE>
<LINE>what I would speak of concerns him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To CLAUDIO</STAGEDIR>  Means your lordship to be married</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know he does.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not that, when he knows what I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may think I love you not: let that appear</LINE>
<LINE>hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will</LINE>
<LINE>manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you</LINE>
<LINE>well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect</LINE>
<LINE>your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and</LINE>
<LINE>labour ill bestowed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances</LINE>
<LINE>shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,</LINE>
<LINE>the lady is disloyal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Disloyal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I</LINE>
<LINE>could say she were worse: think you of a worse</LINE>
<LINE>title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till</LINE>
<LINE>further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall</LINE>
<LINE>see her chamber-window entered, even the night</LINE>
<LINE>before her wedding-day: if you love her then,</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour</LINE>
<LINE>to change your mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May this be so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not think it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you dare not trust that you see, confess not</LINE>
<LINE>that you know: if you will follow me, I will show</LINE>
<LINE>you enough; and when you have seen more and heard</LINE>
<LINE>more, proceed accordingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry</LINE>
<LINE>her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should</LINE>
<LINE>wed, there will I shame her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join</LINE>
<LINE>with thee to disgrace her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will disparage her no farther till you are my</LINE>
<LINE>witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and</LINE>
<LINE>let the issue show itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O day untowardly turned!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O mischief strangely thwarting!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O plague right well prevented! so will you say when</LINE>
<LINE>you have seen the sequel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A street.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you good men and true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer</LINE>
<LINE>salvation, body and soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if</LINE>
<LINE>they should have any allegiance in them, being</LINE>
<LINE>chosen for the prince's watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, who think you the most desertless man to be</LINE>
<LINE>constable?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can</LINE>
<LINE>write and read.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed</LINE>
<LINE>you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is</LINE>
<LINE>the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both which, master constable,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,</LINE>
<LINE>for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make</LINE>
<LINE>no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,</LINE>
<LINE>let that appear when there is no need of such</LINE>
<LINE>vanity. You are thought here to be the most</LINE>
<LINE>senseless and fit man for the constable of the</LINE>
<LINE>watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your</LINE>
<LINE>charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are</LINE>
<LINE>to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if a' will not stand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and</LINE>
<LINE>presently call the rest of the watch together and</LINE>
<LINE>thank God you are rid of a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none</LINE>
<LINE>of the prince's subjects.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, and they are to meddle with none but the</LINE>
<LINE>prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in</LINE>
<LINE>the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to</LINE>
<LINE>talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what</LINE>
<LINE>belongs to a watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet</LINE>
<LINE>watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should</LINE>
<LINE>offend: only, have a care that your bills be not</LINE>
<LINE>stolen. Well, you are to call at all the</LINE>
<LINE>ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if they will not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if</LINE>
<LINE>they make you not then the better answer, you may</LINE>
<LINE>say they are not the men you took them for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue</LINE>
<LINE>of your office, to be no true man; and, for such</LINE>
<LINE>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,</LINE>
<LINE>why the more is for your honesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay</LINE>
<LINE>hands on him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they</LINE>
<LINE>that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable</LINE>
<LINE>way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him</LINE>
<LINE>show himself what he is and steal out of your company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have been always called a merciful man, partner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more</LINE>
<LINE>a man who hath any honesty in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call</LINE>
<LINE>to the nurse and bid her still it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake</LINE>
<LINE>her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her</LINE>
<LINE>lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis very true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are</LINE>
<LINE>to present the prince's own person: if you meet the</LINE>
<LINE>prince in the night, you may stay him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows</LINE>
<LINE>the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without</LINE>
<LINE>the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought</LINE>
<LINE>to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a</LINE>
<LINE>man against his will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By'r lady, I think it be so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be</LINE>
<LINE>any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your</LINE>
<LINE>fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, neighbour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here</LINE>
<LINE>upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch</LINE>
<LINE>about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being</LINE>
<LINE>there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What Conrade!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Peace! stir not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Conrade, I say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, man; I am at thy elbow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a</LINE>
<LINE>scab follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward</LINE>
<LINE>with thy tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for</LINE>
<LINE>it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,</LINE>
<LINE>utter all to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any</LINE>
<LINE>villany should be so rich; for when rich villains</LINE>
<LINE>have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what</LINE>
<LINE>price they will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that</LINE>
<LINE>the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is</LINE>
<LINE>nothing to a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, it is apparel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, the fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But</LINE>
<LINE>seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion</LINE>
<LINE>is?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile</LINE>
<LINE>thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman: I remember his name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou not hear somebody?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; 'twas the vane on the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this</LINE>
<LINE>fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot</LINE>
<LINE>bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?</LINE>
<LINE>sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers</LINE>
<LINE>in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's</LINE>
<LINE>priests in the old church-window, sometime like the</LINE>
<LINE>shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,</LINE>
<LINE>where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears</LINE>
<LINE>out more apparel than the man. But art not thou</LINE>
<LINE>thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night</LINE>
<LINE>wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the</LINE>
<LINE>name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'</LINE>
<LINE>chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good</LINE>
<LINE>night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first</LINE>
<LINE>tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,</LINE>
<LINE>planted and placed and possessed by my master Don</LINE>
<LINE>John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CONRADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thought they Margaret was Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the</LINE>
<LINE>devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly</LINE>
<LINE>by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by</LINE>
<LINE>the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly</LINE>
<LINE>by my villany, which did confirm any slander that</LINE>
<LINE>Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore</LINE>
<LINE>he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning</LINE>
<LINE>at the temple, and there, before the whole</LINE>
<LINE>congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night</LINE>
<LINE>and send her home again without a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call up the right master constable. We have here</LINE>
<LINE>recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that</LINE>
<LINE>ever was known in the commonwealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire</LINE>
<LINE>her to rise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And bid her come hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, I think your other rabato were better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your</LINE>
<LINE>cousin will say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear</LINE>
<LINE>none but this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair</LINE>
<LINE>were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare</LINE>
<LINE>fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's</LINE>
<LINE>gown that they praise so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that exceeds, they say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of</LINE>
<LINE>yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with</LINE>
<LINE>silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,</LINE>
<LINE>and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:</LINE>
<LINE>but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent</LINE>
<LINE>fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is</LINE>
<LINE>exceeding heavy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not</LINE>
<LINE>marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord</LINE>
<LINE>honourable without marriage? I think you would have</LINE>
<LINE>me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad</LINE>
<LINE>thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend</LINE>
<LINE>nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a</LINE>
<LINE>husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband</LINE>
<LINE>and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not</LINE>
<LINE>heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BEATRICE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, coz.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, sweet Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am out of all other tune, methinks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a</LINE>
<LINE>burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your</LINE>
<LINE>husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall</LINE>
<LINE>lack no barns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were</LINE>
<LINE>ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For the letter that begins them all, H.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more</LINE>
<LINE>sailing by the star.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means the fool, trow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These gloves the count sent me; they are an</LINE>
<LINE>excellent perfume.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, God help me! God help me! how long have you</LINE>
<LINE>professed apprehension?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your</LINE>
<LINE>cap. By my troth, I am sick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,</LINE>
<LINE>and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There thou prickest her with a thistle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in</LINE>
<LINE>this Benedictus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I</LINE>
<LINE>meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance</LINE>
<LINE>that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am</LINE>
<LINE>not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list</LINE>
<LINE>not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,</LINE>
<LINE>if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you</LINE>
<LINE>are in love or that you will be in love or that you</LINE>
<LINE>can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and</LINE>
<LINE>now is he become a man: he swore he would never</LINE>
<LINE>marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats</LINE>
<LINE>his meat without grudging: and how you may be</LINE>
<LINE>converted I know not, but methinks you look with</LINE>
<LINE>your eyes as other women do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a false gallop.</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you with me, honest neighbour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you</LINE>
<LINE>that decerns you nearly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this it is, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, in truth it is, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it, my good friends?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the</LINE>
<LINE>matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so</LINE>
<LINE>blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,</LINE>
<LINE>in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living</LINE>
<LINE>that is an old man and no honester than I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neighbours, you are tedious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the</LINE>
<LINE>poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,</LINE>
<LINE>if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in</LINE>
<LINE>my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All thy tediousness on me, ah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for</LINE>
<LINE>I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any</LINE>
<LINE>man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I</LINE>
<LINE>am glad to hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so am I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain know what you have to say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your</LINE>
<LINE>worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant</LINE>
<LINE>knaves as any in Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they</LINE>
<LINE>say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help</LINE>
<LINE>us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,</LINE>
<LINE>neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men</LINE>
<LINE>ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest</LINE>
<LINE>soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever</LINE>
<LINE>broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men</LINE>
<LINE>are not alike; alas, good neighbour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gifts that God gives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must leave you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed</LINE>
<LINE>comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would</LINE>
<LINE>have them this morning examined before your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I</LINE>
<LINE>am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be suffigance.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain</LINE>
<LINE>form of marriage, and you shall recount their</LINE>
<LINE>particular duties afterwards.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If either of you know any inward impediment why you</LINE>
<LINE>should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,</LINE>
<LINE>to utter it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you any, Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you any, count?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare make his answer, none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily</LINE>
<LINE>do, not knowing what they do!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of</LINE>
<LINE>laughing, as, ah, ha, he!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you with free and unconstrained soul</LINE>
<LINE>Give me this maid, your daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As freely, son, as God did give her me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what have I to give you back, whose worth</LINE>
<LINE>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, unless you render her again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.</LINE>
<LINE>There, Leonato, take her back again:</LINE>
<LINE>Give not this rotten orange to your friend;</LINE>
<LINE>She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.</LINE>
<LINE>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</LINE>
<LINE>O, what authority and show of truth</LINE>
<LINE>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</LINE>
<LINE>Comes not that blood as modest evidence</LINE>
<LINE>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</LINE>
<LINE>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>By these exterior shows? But she is none:</LINE>
<LINE>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you mean, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to be married,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,</LINE>
<LINE>And made defeat of her virginity,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know what you would say: if I have known her,</LINE>
<LINE>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:</LINE>
<LINE>No, Leonato,</LINE>
<LINE>I never tempted her with word too large;</LINE>
<LINE>But, as a brother to his sister, show'd</LINE>
<LINE>Bashful sincerity and comely love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:</LINE>
<LINE>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,</LINE>
<LINE>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;</LINE>
<LINE>But you are more intemperate in your blood</LINE>
<LINE>Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals</LINE>
<LINE>That rage in savage sensuality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet prince, why speak not you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I speak?</LINE>
<LINE>I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about</LINE>
<LINE>To link my dear friend to a common stale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This looks not like a nuptial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True! O God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Leonato, stand I here?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this is so: but what of this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me but move one question to your daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>And, by that fatherly and kindly power</LINE>
<LINE>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, God defend me! how am I beset!</LINE>
<LINE>What kind of catechising call you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To make you answer truly to your name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name</LINE>
<LINE>With any just reproach?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that can Hero;</LINE>
<LINE>Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.</LINE>
<LINE>What man was he talk'd with you yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</LINE>
<LINE>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, my brother and this grieved count</LINE>
<LINE>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night</LINE>
<LINE>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,</LINE>
<LINE>Confess'd the vile encounters they have had</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand times in secret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be spoke of;</LINE>
<LINE>There is not chastity enough in language</LINE>
<LINE>Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,</LINE>
<LINE>If half thy outward graces had been placed</LINE>
<LINE>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</LINE>
<LINE>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!</LINE>
<LINE>For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,</LINE>
<LINE>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,</LINE>
<LINE>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</LINE>
<LINE>And never shall it more be gracious.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Dead, I think. Help, uncle!</LINE>
<LINE>Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Death is the fairest cover for her shame</LINE>
<LINE>That may be wish'd for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, cousin Hero!</LINE>

<LINE>Dost thou look up?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, wherefore should she not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing</LINE>
<LINE>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny</LINE>
<LINE>The story that is printed in her blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:</LINE>
<LINE>For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,</LINE>
<LINE>Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?</LINE>
<LINE>Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?</LINE>
<LINE>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?</LINE>
<LINE>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>Why had I not with charitable hand</LINE>
<LINE>Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,</LINE>
<LINE>Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>I might have said 'No part of it is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?</LINE>
<LINE>But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised</LINE>
<LINE>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</LINE>
<LINE>That I myself was to myself not mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen</LINE>
<LINE>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea</LINE>
<LINE>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again</LINE>
<LINE>And salt too little which may season give</LINE>
<LINE>To her foul-tainted flesh!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sir, be patient.</LINE>
<LINE>For my part, I am so attired in wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>I know not what to say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly not; although, until last night,</LINE>
<LINE>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made</LINE>
<LINE>Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!</LINE>
<LINE>Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,</LINE>
<LINE>Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me a little; for I have only been</LINE>
<LINE>Silent so long and given way unto</LINE>
<LINE>This course of fortune</LINE>
<LINE>By noting of the lady. I have mark'd</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand blushing apparitions</LINE>
<LINE>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</LINE>
<LINE>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;</LINE>
<LINE>And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,</LINE>
<LINE>To burn the errors that these princes hold</LINE>
<LINE>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;</LINE>
<LINE>Trust not my reading nor my observations,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</LINE>
<LINE>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,</LINE>
<LINE>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</LINE>
<LINE>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here</LINE>
<LINE>Under some biting error.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friar, it cannot be.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</LINE>
<LINE>Is that she will not add to her damnation</LINE>
<LINE>A sin of perjury; she not denies it:</LINE>
<LINE>Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse</LINE>
<LINE>That which appears in proper nakedness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They know that do accuse me; I know none:</LINE>
<LINE>If I know more of any man alive</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,</LINE>
<LINE>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Prove you that any man with me conversed</LINE>
<LINE>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,</LINE>
<LINE>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two of them have the very bent of honour;</LINE>
<LINE>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</LINE>
<LINE>The practise of it lives in John the bastard,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</LINE>
<LINE>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,</LINE>
<LINE>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor age so eat up my invention,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Ability in means and choice of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>To quit me of them throughly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pause awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</LINE>
<LINE>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</LINE>
<LINE>And publish it that she is dead indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>Maintain a mourning ostentation</LINE>
<LINE>And on your family's old monument</LINE>
<LINE>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites</LINE>
<LINE>That appertain unto a burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall become of this? what will this do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Change slander to remorse; that is some good:</LINE>
<LINE>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</LINE>
<LINE>But on this travail look for greater birth.</LINE>
<LINE>She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the instant that she was accused,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</LINE>
<LINE>Of every hearer: for it so falls out</LINE>
<LINE>That what we have we prize not to the worth</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then we rack the value, then we find</LINE>
<LINE>The virtue that possession would not show us</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</LINE>
<LINE>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</LINE>
<LINE>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</LINE>
<LINE>Into his study of imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>And every lovely organ of her life</LINE>
<LINE>Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,</LINE>
<LINE>More moving-delicate and full of life,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever love had interest in his liver,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish he had not so accused her,</LINE>
<LINE>No, though he thought his accusation true.</LINE>
<LINE>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</LINE>
<LINE>Will fashion the event in better shape</LINE>
<LINE>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</LINE>
<LINE>But if all aim but this be levell'd false,</LINE>
<LINE>The supposition of the lady's death</LINE>
<LINE>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:</LINE>
<LINE>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</LINE>
<LINE>As best befits her wounded reputation,</LINE>
<LINE>In some reclusive and religious life,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:</LINE>
<LINE>And though you know my inwardness and love</LINE>
<LINE>Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this</LINE>
<LINE>As secretly and justly as your soul</LINE>
<LINE>Should with your body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being that I flow in grief,</LINE>
<LINE>The smallest twine may lead me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well consented: presently away;</LINE>
<LINE>For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not desire that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have no reason; I do it freely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there any way to show such friendship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very even way, but no such friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May a man do it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a man's office, but not yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is</LINE>
<LINE>not that strange?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As strange as the thing I know not. It were as</LINE>
<LINE>possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as</LINE>
<LINE>you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I</LINE>
<LINE>confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not swear, and eat it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make</LINE>
<LINE>him eat it that says I love not you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you not eat your word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, God forgive me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What offence, sweet Beatrice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to</LINE>
<LINE>protest I loved you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And do it with all thy heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love you with so much of my heart that none is</LINE>
<LINE>left to protest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, bid me do any thing for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kill Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! not for the wide world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You kill me to deny it. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, sweet Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in</LINE>
<LINE>you: nay, I pray you, let me go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beatrice,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, I will go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll be friends first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Claudio thine enemy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that</LINE>
<LINE>hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O</LINE>
<LINE>that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they</LINE>
<LINE>come to take hands; and then, with public</LINE>
<LINE>accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,</LINE>
<LINE>--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart</LINE>
<LINE>in the market-place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, Beatrice,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but, Beatrice,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beat--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,</LINE>
<LINE>a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,</LINE>
<LINE>surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I</LINE>
<LINE>had any friend would be a man for my sake! But</LINE>
<LINE>manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into</LINE>
<LINE>compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and</LINE>
<LINE>trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules</LINE>
<LINE>that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a</LINE>
<LINE>man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will</LINE>
<LINE>kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you</LINE>
<LINE>hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your</LINE>
<LINE>cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sexton</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master constable, you go not the way to examine:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief</LINE>
<LINE>Against yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</LINE>
<LINE>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</LINE>
<LINE>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</LINE>
<LINE>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid him speak of patience;</LINE>
<LINE>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine</LINE>
<LINE>And let it answer every strain for strain,</LINE>
<LINE>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,</LINE>
<LINE>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:</LINE>
<LINE>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,</LINE>
<LINE>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</LINE>
<LINE>With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And I of him will gather patience.</LINE>
<LINE>But there is no such man: for, brother, men</LINE>
<LINE>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</LINE>
<LINE>Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,</LINE>
<LINE>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</LINE>
<LINE>Would give preceptial medicine to rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</LINE>
<LINE>Charm ache with air and agony with words:</LINE>
<LINE>No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience</LINE>
<LINE>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>But no man's virtue nor sufficiency</LINE>
<LINE>To be so moral when he shall endure</LINE>
<LINE>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:</LINE>
<LINE>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therein do men from children nothing differ.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;</LINE>
<LINE>For there was never yet philosopher</LINE>
<LINE>That could endure the toothache patiently,</LINE>
<LINE>However they have writ the style of gods</LINE>
<LINE>And made a push at chance and sufferance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;</LINE>
<LINE>Make those that do offend you suffer too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.</LINE>
<LINE>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince</LINE>
<LINE>And all of them that thus dishonour her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good den, good den.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good day to both of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear you. my lords,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have some haste, Leonato.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he could right himself with quarreling,</LINE>
<LINE>Some of us would lie low.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who wrongs him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;</LINE>
<LINE>I fear thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, beshrew my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>If it should give your age such cause of fear:</LINE>
<LINE>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:</LINE>
<LINE>I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>As under privilege of age to brag</LINE>
<LINE>What I have done being young, or what would do</LINE>
<LINE>Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me</LINE>
<LINE>That I am forced to lay my reverence by</LINE>
<LINE>And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,</LINE>
<LINE>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.</LINE>
<LINE>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And she lies buried with her ancestors;</LINE>
<LINE>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,</LINE>
<LINE>Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My villany?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say not right, old man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite his nice fence and his active practise,</LINE>
<LINE>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! I will not have to do with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:</LINE>
<LINE>But that's no matter; let him kill one first;</LINE>
<LINE>Win me and wear me; let him answer me.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:</LINE>
<LINE>Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;</LINE>
<LINE>And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,</LINE>
<LINE>That dare as well answer a man indeed</LINE>
<LINE>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:</LINE>
<LINE>Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother Antony,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,</LINE>
<LINE>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--</LINE>
<LINE>Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,</LINE>
<LINE>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,</LINE>
<LINE>Go anticly, show outward hideousness,</LINE>
<LINE>And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,</LINE>
<LINE>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;</LINE>
<LINE>And this is all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, brother Antony,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, 'tis no matter:</LINE>
<LINE>Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:</LINE>
<LINE>But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing</LINE>
<LINE>But what was true and very full of proof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, my lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not hear you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall, or some of us will smart for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BENEDICK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, signior, what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good day, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part</LINE>
<LINE>almost a fray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We had like to have had our two noses snapped off</LINE>
<LINE>with two old men without teeth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had</LINE>
<LINE>we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came</LINE>
<LINE>to seek you both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are</LINE>
<LINE>high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten</LINE>
<LINE>away. Wilt thou use thy wit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never any did so, though very many have been beside</LINE>
<LINE>their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the</LINE>
<LINE>minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou</LINE>
<LINE>sick, or angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,</LINE>
<LINE>thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you</LINE>
<LINE>charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was</LINE>
<LINE>broke cross.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this light, he changes more and more: I think</LINE>
<LINE>he be angry indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I speak a word in your ear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God bless me from a challenge!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to CLAUDIO</STAGEDIR>  You are a villain; I jest not:</LINE>
<LINE>I will make it good how you dare, with what you</LINE>
<LINE>dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will</LINE>
<LINE>protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet</LINE>
<LINE>lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me</LINE>
<LINE>hear from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, a feast, a feast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's</LINE>
<LINE>head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most</LINE>
<LINE>curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find</LINE>
<LINE>a woodcock too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the</LINE>
<LINE>other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'</LINE>
<LINE>said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a</LINE>
<LINE>great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'</LINE>
<LINE>'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it</LINE>
<LINE>hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'</LINE>
<LINE>'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I</LINE>
<LINE>believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on</LINE>
<LINE>Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;</LINE>
<LINE>there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus</LINE>
<LINE>did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular</LINE>
<LINE>virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou</LINE>
<LINE>wast the properest man in Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For the which she wept heartily and said she cared</LINE>
<LINE>not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she</LINE>
<LINE>did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:</LINE>
<LINE>the old man's daughter told us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was</LINE>
<LINE>hid in the garden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on</LINE>
<LINE>the sensible Benedick's head?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the</LINE>
<LINE>married man'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave</LINE>
<LINE>you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests</LINE>
<LINE>as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,</LINE>
<LINE>hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank</LINE>
<LINE>you: I must discontinue your company: your brother</LINE>
<LINE>the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among</LINE>
<LINE>you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord</LINE>
<LINE>Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till</LINE>
<LINE>then, peace be with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is in earnest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for</LINE>
<LINE>the love of Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And hath challenged thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sincerely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his</LINE>
<LINE>doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a</LINE>
<LINE>doctor to such a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and</LINE>
<LINE>be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE
and BORACHIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she</LINE>
<LINE>shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,</LINE>
<LINE>an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio</LINE>
<LINE>one!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hearken after their offence, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Officers, what offence have these men done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, they have committed false report;</LINE>
<LINE>moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,</LINE>
<LINE>they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have</LINE>
<LINE>belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust</LINE>
<LINE>things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I</LINE>
<LINE>ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why</LINE>
<LINE>they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay</LINE>
<LINE>to their charge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by</LINE>
<LINE>my troth, there's one meaning well suited.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus</LINE>
<LINE>bound to your answer? this learned constable is</LINE>
<LINE>too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:</LINE>
<LINE>do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have</LINE>
<LINE>deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms</LINE>
<LINE>could not discover, these shallow fools have brought</LINE>
<LINE>to light: who in the night overheard me confessing</LINE>
<LINE>to this man how Don John your brother incensed me</LINE>
<LINE>to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into</LINE>
<LINE>the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's</LINE>
<LINE>garments, how you disgraced her, when you should</LINE>
<LINE>marry her: my villany they have upon record; which</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather seal with my death than repeat over</LINE>
<LINE>to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my</LINE>
<LINE>master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire</LINE>
<LINE>nothing but the reward of a villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But did my brother set thee on to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is composed and framed of treachery:</LINE>
<LINE>And fled he is upon this villany.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear</LINE>
<LINE>In the rare semblance that I loved it first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our</LINE>
<LINE>sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:</LINE>
<LINE>and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time</LINE>
<LINE>and place shall serve, that I am an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERGES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the</LINE>
<LINE>Sexton too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when I note another man like him,</LINE>
<LINE>I may avoid him: which of these is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you would know your wronger, look on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd</LINE>
<LINE>Mine innocent child?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, even I alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:</LINE>
<LINE>Here stand a pair of honourable men;</LINE>
<LINE>A third is fled, that had a hand in it.</LINE>
<LINE>I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:</LINE>
<LINE>Record it with your high and worthy deeds:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not how to pray your patience;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;</LINE>
<LINE>Impose me to what penance your invention</LINE>
<LINE>Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not</LINE>
<LINE>But in mistaking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my soul, nor I:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, to satisfy this good old man,</LINE>
<LINE>I would bend under any heavy weight</LINE>
<LINE>That he'll enjoin me to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;</LINE>
<LINE>That were impossible: but, I pray you both,</LINE>
<LINE>Possess the people in Messina here</LINE>
<LINE>How innocent she died; and if your love</LINE>
<LINE>Can labour ought in sad invention,</LINE>
<LINE>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb</LINE>
<LINE>And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow morning come you to my house,</LINE>
<LINE>And since you could not be my son-in-law,</LINE>
<LINE>Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Almost the copy of my child that's dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And she alone is heir to both of us:</LINE>
<LINE>Give her the right you should have given her cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>And so dies my revenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!</LINE>
<LINE>I do embrace your offer; and dispose</LINE>
<LINE>For henceforth of poor Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow then I will expect your coming;</LINE>
<LINE>To-night I take my leave. This naughty man</LINE>
<LINE>Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>Hired to it by your brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORACHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by my soul, she was not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,</LINE>
<LINE>But always hath been just and virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>In any thing that I do know by her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and</LINE>
<LINE>black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call</LINE>
<LINE>me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his</LINE>
<LINE>punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of</LINE>
<LINE>one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and</LINE>
<LINE>a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's</LINE>
<LINE>name, the which he hath used so long and never paid</LINE>
<LINE>that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing</LINE>
<LINE>for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship speaks like a most thankful and</LINE>
<LINE>reverend youth; and I praise God for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's for thy pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save the foundation!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOGBERRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I</LINE>
<LINE>beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the</LINE>
<LINE>example of others. God keep your worship! I wish</LINE>
<LINE>your worship well; God restore you to health! I</LINE>
<LINE>humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry</LINE>
<LINE>meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>To the Watch</STAGEDIR>  Bring you these fellows on. We'll</LINE>
<LINE>talk with Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt, severally</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  LEONATO'S garden.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at</LINE>
<LINE>my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living</LINE>
<LINE>shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou</LINE>
<LINE>deservest it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To have no man come over me! why, shall I always</LINE>
<LINE>keep below stairs?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,</LINE>
<LINE>but hurt not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a</LINE>
<LINE>woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give</LINE>
<LINE>thee the bucklers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the</LINE>
<LINE>pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And therefore will come.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit MARGARET</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Sings</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The god of love,</LINE>
<LINE>That sits above,</LINE>
<LINE>And knows me, and knows me,</LINE>
<LINE>How pitiful I deserve,--</LINE>
<LINE>I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good</LINE>
<LINE>swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and</LINE>
<LINE>a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,</LINE>
<LINE>whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a</LINE>
<LINE>blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned</LINE>
<LINE>over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I</LINE>
<LINE>cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find</LINE>
<LINE>out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent</LINE>
<LINE>rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,</LINE>
<LINE>'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous</LINE>
<LINE>endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,</LINE>
<LINE>nor I cannot woo in festival terms.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BEATRICE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, stay but till then!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere</LINE>
<LINE>I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with</LINE>
<LINE>knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but</LINE>
<LINE>foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I</LINE>
<LINE>will depart unkissed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,</LINE>
<LINE>so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee</LINE>
<LINE>plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either</LINE>
<LINE>I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe</LINE>
<LINE>him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for</LINE>
<LINE>which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For them all together; which maintained so politic</LINE>
<LINE>a state of evil that they will not admit any good</LINE>
<LINE>part to intermingle with them. But for which of my</LINE>
<LINE>good parts did you first suffer love for me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love</LINE>
<LINE>indeed, for I love thee against my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!</LINE>
<LINE>If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for</LINE>
<LINE>yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It appears not in this confession: there's not one</LINE>
<LINE>wise man among twenty that will praise himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in</LINE>
<LINE>the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect</LINE>
<LINE>in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live</LINE>
<LINE>no longer in monument than the bell rings and the</LINE>
<LINE>widow weeps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how long is that, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in</LINE>
<LINE>rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the</LINE>
<LINE>wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no</LINE>
<LINE>impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his</LINE>
<LINE>own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for</LINE>
<LINE>praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is</LINE>
<LINE>praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very ill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how do you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very ill too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave</LINE>
<LINE>you too, for here comes one in haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter URSULA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URSULA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old</LINE>
<LINE>coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been</LINE>
<LINE>falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily</LINE>
<LINE>abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is</LINE>
<LINE>fed and gone. Will you come presently?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you go hear this news, signior?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be</LINE>
<LINE>buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with</LINE>
<LINE>thee to thy uncle's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A church.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four
with tapers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the monument of Leonato?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is, my lord.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reading out of a scroll</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Done to death by slanderous tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Was the Hero that here lies:</LINE>
<LINE>Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives her fame which never dies.</LINE>
<LINE>So the life that died with shame</LINE>
<LINE>Lives in death with glorious fame.</LINE>
<LINE>Hang thou there upon the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>Praising her when I am dumb.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>Pardon, goddess of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Those that slew thy virgin knight;</LINE>
<LINE>For the which, with songs of woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Round about her tomb they go.</LINE>
<LINE>Midnight, assist our moan;</LINE>
<LINE>Help us to sigh and groan,</LINE>
<LINE>Heavily, heavily:</LINE>
<LINE>Graves, yawn and yield your dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Till death be uttered,</LINE>
<LINE>Heavily, heavily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, unto thy bones good night!</LINE>
<LINE>Yearly will I do this rite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:</LINE>
<LINE>The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about</LINE>
<LINE>Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.</LINE>
<LINE>Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, masters: each his several way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;</LINE>
<LINE>And then to Leonato's we will go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's</LINE>
<LINE>Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  A room in LEONATO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE,
MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I not tell you she was innocent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the error that you heard debated:</LINE>
<LINE>But Margaret was in some fault for this,</LINE>
<LINE>Although against her will, as it appears</LINE>
<LINE>In the true course of all the question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so am I, being else by faith enforced</LINE>
<LINE>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,</LINE>
<LINE>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Ladies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The prince and Claudio promised by this hour</LINE>
<LINE>To visit me. You know your office, brother:</LINE>
<LINE>You must be father to your brother's daughter</LINE>
<LINE>And give her to young Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To do what, signior?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To bind me, or undo me; one of them.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</LINE>
<LINE>Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I do with an eye of love requite her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sight whereof I think you had from me,</LINE>
<LINE>From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:</LINE>
<LINE>But, for my will, my will is your good will</LINE>
<LINE>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd</LINE>
<LINE>In the state of honourable marriage:</LINE>
<LINE>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart is with your liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And my help.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the prince and Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or
three others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to this fair assembly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:</LINE>
<LINE>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</LINE>
<LINE>To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit ANTONIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>That you have such a February face,</LINE>
<LINE>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</LINE>
<LINE>Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold</LINE>
<LINE>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,</LINE>
<LINE>When he would play the noble beast in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;</LINE>
<LINE>And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,</LINE>
<LINE>And got a calf in that same noble feat</LINE>
<LINE>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This same is she, and I do give you her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that you shall not, till you take her hand</LINE>
<LINE>Before this friar and swear to marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand: before this holy friar,</LINE>
<LINE>I am your husband, if you like of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when I lived, I was your other wife:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Unmasking</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And when you loved, you were my other husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Another Hero!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing certainer:</LINE>
<LINE>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,</LINE>
<LINE>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR FRANCIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this amazement can I qualify:</LINE>
<LINE>When after that the holy rites are ended,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the chapel let us presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Unmasking</STAGEDIR>  I answer to that name. What is your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not you love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, no; no more than reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio</LINE>
<LINE>Have been deceived; they swore you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not you love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, no; no more than reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula</LINE>
<LINE>Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They swore that you were almost sick for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;</LINE>
<LINE>For here's a paper written in his hand,</LINE>
<LINE>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Fashion'd to Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here's another</LINE>
<LINE>Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,</LINE>
<LINE>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take</LINE>
<LINE>thee for pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEATRICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield</LINE>
<LINE>upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,</LINE>
<LINE>for I was told you were in a consumption.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace! I will stop your mouth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kissing her</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DON PEDRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of</LINE>
<LINE>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost</LINE>
<LINE>thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:</LINE>
<LINE>if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear</LINE>
<LINE>nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do</LINE>
<LINE>purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any</LINE>
<LINE>purpose that the world can say against it; and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore never flout at me for what I have said</LINE>
<LINE>against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my</LINE>
<LINE>conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to</LINE>
<LINE>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my</LINE>
<LINE>kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,</LINE>
<LINE>that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single</LINE>
<LINE>life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of</LINE>
<LINE>question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look</LINE>
<LINE>exceedingly narrowly to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere</LINE>
<LINE>we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts</LINE>
<LINE>and our wives' heels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll have dancing afterward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:</LINE>
<LINE>there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,</LINE>
<LINE>And brought with armed men back to Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENEDICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think not on him till to-morrow:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.</LINE>
<LINE>Strike up, pipers.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long live the king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bernardo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You come most carefully upon your hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am sick at heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you had quiet guard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a mouse stirring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, good night.</LINE>
<LINE>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</LINE>
<LINE>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friends to this ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And liegemen to the Dane.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give you good night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, farewell, honest soldier:</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath relieved you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bernardo has my place.</LINE>
<LINE>Give you good night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Holla! Bernardo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say,</LINE>
<LINE>What, is Horatio there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A piece of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have seen nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not let belief take hold of him</LINE>
<LINE>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I have entreated him along</LINE>
<LINE>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</LINE>
<LINE>That if again this apparition come,</LINE>
<LINE>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit down awhile;</LINE>
<LINE>And let us once again assail your ears,</LINE>
<LINE>That are so fortified against our story</LINE>
<LINE>What we have two nights seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sit we down,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last night of all,</LINE>
<LINE>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</LINE>
<LINE>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>The bell then beating one,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would be spoke to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Question it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with that fair and warlike form</LINE>
<LINE>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is offended.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, it stalks away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this something more than fantasy?</LINE>
<LINE>What think you on't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before my God, I might not this believe</LINE>
<LINE>Without the sensible and true avouch</LINE>
<LINE>Of mine own eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it not like the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou art to thyself:</LINE>
<LINE>Such was the very armour he had on</LINE>
<LINE>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</LINE>
<LINE>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</LINE>
<LINE>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</LINE>
<LINE>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what particular thought to work I know not;</LINE>
<LINE>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Why this same strict and most observant watch</LINE>
<LINE>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</LINE>
<LINE>And foreign mart for implements of war;</LINE>
<LINE>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</LINE>
<LINE>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</LINE>
<LINE>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</LINE>
<LINE>Who is't that can inform me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That can I;</LINE>
<LINE>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</LINE>
<LINE>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</LINE>
<LINE>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</LINE>
<LINE>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</LINE>
<LINE>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</LINE>
<LINE>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</LINE>
<LINE>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</LINE>
<LINE>Against the which, a moiety competent</LINE>
<LINE>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</LINE>
<LINE>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</LINE>
<LINE>And carriage of the article design'd,</LINE>
<LINE>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</LINE>
<LINE>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</LINE>
<LINE>For food and diet, to some enterprise</LINE>
<LINE>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</LINE>
<LINE>As it doth well appear unto our state--</LINE>
<LINE>But to recover of us, by strong hand</LINE>
<LINE>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</LINE>
<LINE>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the main motive of our preparations,</LINE>
<LINE>The source of this our watch and the chief head</LINE>
<LINE>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be no other but e'en so:</LINE>
<LINE>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</LINE>
<LINE>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</LINE>
<LINE>That was and is the question of these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</LINE>
<LINE>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</LINE>
<LINE>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</LINE>
<LINE>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</LINE>
<LINE>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</LINE>
<LINE>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</LINE>
<LINE>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</LINE>
<LINE>As harbingers preceding still the fates</LINE>
<LINE>And prologue to the omen coming on,</LINE>
<LINE>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</LINE>
<LINE>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me:</LINE>
<LINE>If there be any good thing to be done,</LINE>
<LINE>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Cock crows</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</LINE>
<LINE>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</LINE>
<LINE>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, if it will not stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis gone!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>To offer it the show of violence;</LINE>
<LINE>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</LINE>
<LINE>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then it started like a guilty thing</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</LINE>
<LINE>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</LINE>
<LINE>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</LINE>
<LINE>To his confine: and of the truth herein</LINE>
<LINE>This present object made probation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</LINE>
<LINE>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</LINE>
<LINE>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</LINE>
<LINE>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</LINE>
<LINE>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</LINE>
<LINE>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</LINE>
<LINE>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</LINE>
<LINE>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</LINE>
<LINE>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</LINE>
<LINE>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know</LINE>
<LINE>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</LINE>
<LINE>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</LINE>
<LINE>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</LINE>
<LINE>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</LINE>
<LINE>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</LINE>
<LINE>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</LINE>
<LINE>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--</LINE>
<LINE>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</LINE>
<LINE>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</LINE>
<LINE>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</LINE>
<LINE>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</LINE>
<LINE>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</LINE>
<LINE>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</LINE>
<LINE>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</LINE>
<LINE>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</LINE>
<LINE>Importing the surrender of those lands</LINE>
<LINE>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</LINE>
<LINE>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</LINE>
<LINE>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</LINE>
<LINE>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</LINE>
<LINE>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress</LINE>
<LINE>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</LINE>
<LINE>The lists and full proportions, are all made</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</LINE>
<LINE>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</LINE>
<LINE>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</LINE>
<LINE>Giving to you no further personal power</LINE>
<LINE>To business with the king, more than the scope</LINE>
<LINE>Of these delated articles allow.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>VOLTIMAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In that and all things will we show our duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?</LINE>
<LINE>You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</LINE>
<LINE>And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</LINE>
<LINE>The head is not more native to the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</LINE>
<LINE>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My dread lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Your leave and favour to return to France;</LINE>
<LINE>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</LINE>
<LINE>To show my duty in your coronation,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</LINE>
<LINE>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</LINE>
<LINE>By laboursome petition, and at last</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</LINE>
<LINE>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</LINE>
<LINE>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</LINE>
<LINE>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</LINE>
<LINE>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,</LINE>
<LINE>Passing through nature to eternity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, it is common.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be,</LINE>
<LINE>Why seems it so particular with thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</LINE>
<LINE>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</LINE>
<LINE>For they are actions that a man might play:</LINE>
<LINE>But I have that within which passeth show;</LINE>
<LINE>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>To give these mourning duties to your father:</LINE>
<LINE>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</LINE>
<LINE>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</LINE>
<LINE>In filial obligation for some term</LINE>
<LINE>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</LINE>
<LINE>In obstinate condolement is a course</LINE>
<LINE>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</LINE>
<LINE>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</LINE>
<LINE>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</LINE>
<LINE>For what we know must be and is as common</LINE>
<LINE>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</LINE>
<LINE>Why should we in our peevish opposition</LINE>
<LINE>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</LINE>
<LINE>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</LINE>
<LINE>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</LINE>
<LINE>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</LINE>
<LINE>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</LINE>
<LINE>As of a father: for let the world take note,</LINE>
<LINE>You are the most immediate to our throne;</LINE>
<LINE>And with no less nobility of love</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</LINE>
<LINE>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</LINE>
<LINE>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</LINE>
<LINE>It is most retrograde to our desire:</LINE>
<LINE>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</LINE>
<LINE>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:</LINE>
<LINE>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</LINE>
<LINE>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</LINE>
<LINE>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</LINE>
<LINE>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</LINE>
<LINE>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,</LINE>
<LINE>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but HAMLET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt</LINE>
<LINE>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</LINE>
<LINE>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd</LINE>
<LINE>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</LINE>
<LINE>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</LINE>
<LINE>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</LINE>
<LINE>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</LINE>
<LINE>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</LINE>
<LINE>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</LINE>
<LINE>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</LINE>
<LINE>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</LINE>
<LINE>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</LINE>
<LINE>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</LINE>
<LINE>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</LINE>
<LINE>As if increase of appetite had grown</LINE>
<LINE>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--</LINE>
<LINE>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</LINE>
<LINE>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,</LINE>
<LINE>Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--</LINE>
<LINE>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>My father's brother, but no more like my father</LINE>
<LINE>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</LINE>
<LINE>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</LINE>
<LINE>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</LINE>
<LINE>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</LINE>
<LINE>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</LINE>
<LINE>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail to your lordship!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to see you well:</LINE>
<LINE>Horatio,--or I do forget myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:</LINE>
<LINE>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good lord--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A truant disposition, good my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not hear your enemy say so,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</LINE>
<LINE>To make it truster of your own report</LINE>
<LINE>Against yourself: I know you are no truant.</LINE>
<LINE>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</LINE>
<LINE>We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;</LINE>
<LINE>I think it was to see my mother's wedding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats</LINE>
<LINE>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</LINE>
<LINE>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</LINE>
<LINE>My father!--methinks I see my father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In my mind's eye, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was a man, take him for all in all,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not look upon his like again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw? who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the king your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king my father!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Season your admiration for awhile</LINE>
<LINE>With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>This marvel to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For God's love, let me hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</LINE>
<LINE>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,</LINE>
<LINE>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</LINE>
<LINE>Appears before them, and with solemn march</LINE>
<LINE>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd</LINE>
<LINE>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</LINE>
<LINE>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</LINE>
<LINE>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</LINE>
<LINE>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,</LINE>
<LINE>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</LINE>
<LINE>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</LINE>
<LINE>These hands are not more like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But where was this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you not speak to it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I did;</LINE>
<LINE>But answer made it none: yet once methought</LINE>
<LINE>It lifted up its head and did address</LINE>
<LINE>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</LINE>
<LINE>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</LINE>
<LINE>And vanish'd from our sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis very strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;</LINE>
<LINE>And we did think it writ down in our duty</LINE>
<LINE>To let you know of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</LINE>
<LINE>Hold you the watch to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arm'd, say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arm'd, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From top to toe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, from head to foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then saw you not his face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, look'd he frowningly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pale or red?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, very pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And fix'd his eyes upon you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most constantly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had been there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would have much amazed you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Longer, longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not when I saw't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His beard was grizzled--no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was, as I have seen it in his life,</LINE>
<LINE>A sable silver'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will watch to-night;</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance 'twill walk again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant it will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it assume my noble father's person,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</LINE>
<LINE>If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Let it be tenable in your silence still;</LINE>
<LINE>And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>Give it an understanding, but no tongue:</LINE>
<LINE>I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll visit you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our duty to your honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but HAMLET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!</LINE>
<LINE>Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,</LINE>
<LINE>Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A room in Polonius' house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</LINE>
<LINE>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</LINE>
<LINE>And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>But let me hear from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you doubt that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</LINE>
<LINE>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</LINE>
<LINE>The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more but so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think it no more;</LINE>
<LINE>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</LINE>
<LINE>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</LINE>
<LINE>The inward service of the mind and soul</LINE>
<LINE>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</LINE>
<LINE>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</LINE>
<LINE>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</LINE>
<LINE>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</LINE>
<LINE>For he himself is subject to his birth:</LINE>
<LINE>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</LINE>
<LINE>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</LINE>
<LINE>The safety and health of this whole state;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</LINE>
<LINE>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</LINE>
<LINE>As he in his particular act and place</LINE>
<LINE>May give his saying deed; which is no further</LINE>
<LINE>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</LINE>
<LINE>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</LINE>
<LINE>To his unmaster'd importunity.</LINE>
<LINE>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</LINE>
<LINE>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</LINE>
<LINE>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</LINE>
<LINE>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</LINE>
<LINE>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</LINE>
<LINE>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</LINE>
<LINE>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</LINE>
<LINE>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</LINE>
<LINE>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,</LINE>
<LINE>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</LINE>
<LINE>And recks not his own rede.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, fear me not.</LINE>
<LINE>I stay too long: but here my father comes.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A double blessing is a double grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</LINE>
<LINE>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</LINE>
<LINE>And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</LINE>
<LINE>And these few precepts in thy memory</LINE>
<LINE>See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</LINE>
<LINE>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</LINE>
<LINE>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</LINE>
<LINE>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware</LINE>
<LINE>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</LINE>
<LINE>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</LINE>
<LINE>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</LINE>
<LINE>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</LINE>
<LINE>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</LINE>
<LINE>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</LINE>
<LINE>And they in France of the best rank and station</LINE>
<LINE>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</LINE>
<LINE>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</LINE>
<LINE>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</LINE>
<LINE>This above all: to thine ownself be true,</LINE>
<LINE>And it must follow, as the night the day,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The time invites you; go; your servants tend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well</LINE>
<LINE>What I have said to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis in my memory lock'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, well bethought:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</LINE>
<LINE>Given private time to you; and you yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</LINE>
<LINE>And that in way of caution, I must tell you,</LINE>
<LINE>You do not understand yourself so clearly</LINE>
<LINE>As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</LINE>
<LINE>What is between you? give me up the truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</LINE>
<LINE>Of his affection to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,</LINE>
<LINE>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;</LINE>
<LINE>That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;</LINE>
<LINE>Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</LINE>
<LINE>Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, he hath importuned me with love</LINE>
<LINE>In honourable fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</LINE>
<LINE>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</LINE>
<LINE>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</LINE>
<LINE>You must not take for fire. From this time</LINE>
<LINE>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</LINE>
<LINE>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</LINE>
<LINE>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>Believe so much in him, that he is young</LINE>
<LINE>And with a larger tether may he walk</LINE>
<LINE>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</LINE>
<LINE>Not of that dye which their investments show,</LINE>
<LINE>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</LINE>
<LINE>The better to beguile. This is for all:</LINE>
<LINE>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</LINE>
<LINE>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</LINE>
<LINE>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall obey, my lord.</LINE>

</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  The platform.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a nipping and an eager air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hour now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it lacks of twelve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, it is struck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What does this mean, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</LINE>
<LINE>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</LINE>
<LINE>The triumph of his pledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it a custom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, is't:</LINE>
<LINE>But to my mind, though I am native here</LINE>
<LINE>And to the manner born, it is a custom</LINE>
<LINE>More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</LINE>
<LINE>This heavy-headed revel east and west</LINE>
<LINE>Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</LINE>
<LINE>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</LINE>
<LINE>Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</LINE>
<LINE>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</LINE>
<LINE>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</LINE>
<LINE>So, oft it chances in particular men,</LINE>
<LINE>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</LINE>
<LINE>As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,</LINE>
<LINE>Since nature cannot choose his origin--</LINE>
<LINE>By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</LINE>
<LINE>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</LINE>
<LINE>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</LINE>
<LINE>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</LINE>
<LINE>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</LINE>
<LINE>Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,</LINE>
<LINE>As infinite as man may undergo--</LINE>
<LINE>Shall in the general censure take corruption</LINE>
<LINE>From that particular fault: the dram of eale</LINE>
<LINE>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</LINE>
<LINE>To his own scandal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, my lord, it comes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou comest in such a questionable shape</LINE>
<LINE>That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</LINE>
<LINE>Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</LINE>
<LINE>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</LINE>
<LINE>To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</LINE>
<LINE>Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Making night hideous; and we fools of nature</LINE>
<LINE>So horridly to shake our disposition</LINE>
<LINE>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</LINE>
<LINE>Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Ghost beckons HAMLET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It beckons you to go away with it,</LINE>
<LINE>As if it some impartment did desire</LINE>
<LINE>To you alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, with what courteous action</LINE>
<LINE>It waves you to a more removed ground:</LINE>
<LINE>But do not go with it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by no means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will not speak; then I will follow it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what should be the fear?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not set my life in a pin's fee;</LINE>
<LINE>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a thing immortal as itself?</LINE>
<LINE>It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</LINE>

<LINE>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</LINE>
<LINE>That beetles o'er his base into the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And there assume some other horrible form,</LINE>
<LINE>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</LINE>
<LINE>And draw you into madness? think of it:</LINE>
<LINE>The very place puts toys of desperation,</LINE>
<LINE>Without more motive, into every brain</LINE>
<LINE>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</LINE>
<LINE>And hears it roar beneath.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hour is almost come,</LINE>
<LINE>When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</LINE>
<LINE>Must render up myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor ghost!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</LINE>
<LINE>To what I shall unfold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak; I am bound to hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am thy father's spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And for the day confined to fast in fires,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</LINE>
<LINE>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</LINE>
<LINE>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</LINE>
<LINE>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy knotted and combined locks to part</LINE>
<LINE>And each particular hair to stand on end,</LINE>
<LINE>Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:</LINE>
<LINE>But this eternal blazon must not be</LINE>
<LINE>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou didst ever thy dear father love--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Murder!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Murder most foul, as in the best it is;</LINE>
<LINE>But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift</LINE>
<LINE>As meditation or the thoughts of love,</LINE>
<LINE>May sweep to my revenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I find thee apt;</LINE>
<LINE>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</LINE>
<LINE>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>Is by a forged process of my death</LINE>
<LINE>Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,</LINE>
<LINE>The serpent that did sting thy father's life</LINE>
<LINE>Now wears his crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</LINE>
<LINE>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--</LINE>
<LINE>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</LINE>
<LINE>So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust</LINE>
<LINE>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</LINE>
<LINE>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</LINE>
<LINE>From me, whose love was of that dignity</LINE>
<LINE>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</LINE>
<LINE>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</LINE>
<LINE>To those of mine!</LINE>
<LINE>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</LINE>
<LINE>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And prey on garbage.</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</LINE>
<LINE>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>My custom always of the afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</LINE>
<LINE>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the porches of my ears did pour</LINE>
<LINE>The leperous distilment; whose effect</LINE>
<LINE>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</LINE>
<LINE>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</LINE>
<LINE>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</LINE>
<LINE>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</LINE>
<LINE>The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</LINE>
<LINE>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</LINE>
<LINE>All my smooth body.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</LINE>
<LINE>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</LINE>
<LINE>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</LINE>
<LINE>With all my imperfections on my head:</LINE>
<LINE>O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</LINE>
<LINE>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</LINE>
<LINE>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</LINE>
<LINE>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</LINE>
<LINE>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven</LINE>
<LINE>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,</LINE>
<LINE>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</LINE>
<LINE>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,</LINE>
<LINE>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat</LINE>
<LINE>In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, from the table of my memory</LINE>
<LINE>I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</LINE>
<LINE>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,</LINE>
<LINE>That youth and observation copied there;</LINE>
<LINE>And thy commandment all alone shall live</LINE>
<LINE>Within the book and volume of my brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>O most pernicious woman!</LINE>
<LINE>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</LINE>
<LINE>My tables,--meet it is I set it down,</LINE>
<LINE>That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;</LINE>
<LINE>At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Writing</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;</LINE>
<LINE>It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Good my lord, tell it.</LINE>

<LINE>There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave</LINE>
<LINE>To tell us this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, right; you are i' the right;</LINE>
<LINE>And so, without more circumstance at all,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:</LINE>
<LINE>You, as your business and desire shall point you;</LINE>
<LINE>For every man has business and desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,</LINE>
<LINE>Look you, I'll go pray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;</LINE>
<LINE>Yes, 'faith heartily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no offence, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,</LINE>
<LINE>And much offence too. Touching this vision here,</LINE>
<LINE>It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:</LINE>
<LINE>For your desire to know what is between us,</LINE>
<LINE>O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,</LINE>
<LINE>As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me one poor request.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is't, my lord? we will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</LINE>
<LINE>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;</LINE>
<LINE>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,</LINE>
<LINE>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</LINE>
<LINE>To put an antic disposition on,</LINE>
<LINE>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,</LINE>
<LINE>With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'</LINE>
<LINE>Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'</LINE>
<LINE>Or such ambiguous giving out, to note</LINE>
<LINE>That you know aught of me: this not to do,</LINE>
<LINE>So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.</LINE>

<LINE>So, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>With all my love I do commend me to you:</LINE>
<LINE>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is</LINE>
<LINE>May do, to express his love and friending to you,</LINE>
<LINE>God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;</LINE>
<LINE>And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.</LINE>
<LINE>The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever I was born to set it right!</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, come, let's go together.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</LINE>
<LINE>Before you visit him, to make inquire</LINE>
<LINE>Of his behavior.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I did intend it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</LINE>
<LINE>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</LINE>
<LINE>What company, at what expense; and finding</LINE>
<LINE>By this encompassment and drift of question</LINE>
<LINE>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</LINE>
<LINE>Than your particular demands will touch it:</LINE>
<LINE>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</LINE>
<LINE>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, very well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</LINE>
<LINE>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</LINE>
<LINE>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</LINE>
<LINE>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</LINE>
<LINE>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</LINE>
<LINE>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</LINE>
<LINE>As are companions noted and most known</LINE>
<LINE>To youth and liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As gaming, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</LINE>
<LINE>Drabbing: you may go so far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, that would dishonour him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</LINE>
<LINE>You must not put another scandal on him,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is open to incontinency;</LINE>
<LINE>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</LINE>
<LINE>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</LINE>
<LINE>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</LINE>
<LINE>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Of general assault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, my good lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore should you do this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I would know that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, here's my drift;</LINE>
<LINE>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</LINE>
<LINE>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</LINE>
<LINE>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</LINE>
<LINE>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</LINE>
<LINE>He closes with you in this consequence;</LINE>
<LINE>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</LINE>
<LINE>According to the phrase or the addition</LINE>
<LINE>Of man and country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very good, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</LINE>
<LINE>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</LINE>
<LINE>something: where did I leave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REYNALDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</LINE>
<LINE>and 'gentleman.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</LINE>
<LINE>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</LINE>
<LINE>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</LINE>
<LINE>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</LINE>
<LINE>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</LINE>
<LINE>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</LINE>
<LINE>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</LINE>
<LINE>See you now;</LINE>
<LINE>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</LINE>
<LINE>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</LINE>
<LINE>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</LINE>
<LINE>By indirections find directions out:</LINE>
<LINE>So by my former lecture and advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</LINE>
<LINE>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</LINE>
<LINE>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</LINE>
<LINE>And with a look so piteous in purport</LINE>
<LINE>As if he had been loosed out of hell</LINE>
<LINE>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mad for thy love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I do not know;</LINE>
<LINE>But truly, I do fear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What said he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</LINE>
<LINE>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</LINE>
<LINE>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</LINE>
<LINE>He falls to such perusal of my face</LINE>
<LINE>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</LINE>
<LINE>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</LINE>
<LINE>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</LINE>
<LINE>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</LINE>
<LINE>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</LINE>
<LINE>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</LINE>
<LINE>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the very ecstasy of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose violent property fordoes itself</LINE>
<LINE>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</LINE>
<LINE>As oft as any passion under heaven</LINE>
<LINE>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</LINE>
<LINE>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</LINE>
<LINE>I did repel his fetters and denied</LINE>
<LINE>His access to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That hath made him mad.</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</LINE>
<LINE>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</LINE>
<LINE>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</LINE>
<LINE>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</LINE>
<LINE>As it is common for the younger sort</LINE>
<LINE>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</LINE>
<LINE>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</LINE>
<LINE>move</LINE>
<LINE>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A room in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</LINE>
<LINE>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</LINE>
<LINE>The need we have to use you did provoke</LINE>
<LINE>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</LINE>
<LINE>Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</LINE>
<LINE>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</LINE>
<LINE>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</LINE>
<LINE>More than his father's death, that thus hath put him</LINE>
<LINE>So much from the understanding of himself,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,</LINE>
<LINE>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</LINE>
<LINE>Some little time: so by your companies</LINE>
<LINE>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</LINE>
<LINE>So much as from occasion you may glean,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</LINE>
<LINE>That, open'd, lies within our remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;</LINE>
<LINE>And sure I am two men there are not living</LINE>
<LINE>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</LINE>
<LINE>To show us so much gentry and good will</LINE>
<LINE>As to expend your time with us awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>For the supply and profit of our hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</LINE>
<LINE>As fits a king's remembrance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both your majesties</LINE>
<LINE>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Put your dread pleasures more into command</LINE>
<LINE>Than to entreaty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But we both obey,</LINE>
<LINE>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent</LINE>
<LINE>To lay our service freely at your feet,</LINE>
<LINE>To be commanded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you instantly to visit</LINE>
<LINE>My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavens make our presence and our practises</LINE>
<LINE>Pleasant and helpful to him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, amen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some
Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Are joyfully return'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou still hast been the father of good news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</LINE>
<LINE>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</LINE>
<LINE>As it hath used to do, that I have found</LINE>
<LINE>The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</LINE>
<LINE>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</LINE>
<LINE>The head and source of all your son's distemper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it is no other but the main;</LINE>
<LINE>His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we shall sift him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Welcome, my good friends!</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLTIMAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</LINE>
<LINE>His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd</LINE>
<LINE>To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</LINE>
<LINE>But, better look'd into, he truly found</LINE>
<LINE>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</LINE>
<LINE>That so his sickness, age and impotence</LINE>
<LINE>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</LINE>
<LINE>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</LINE>
<LINE>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</LINE>
<LINE>Makes vow before his uncle never more</LINE>
<LINE>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</LINE>
<LINE>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>So levied as before, against the Polack:</LINE>
<LINE>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Giving a paper</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That it might please you to give quiet pass</LINE>
<LINE>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>On such regards of safety and allowance</LINE>
<LINE>As therein are set down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It likes us well;</LINE>
<LINE>And at our more consider'd time well read,</LINE>
<LINE>Answer, and think upon this business.</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</LINE>
<LINE>Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:</LINE>
<LINE>Most welcome home!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This business is well ended.</LINE>
<LINE>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</LINE>
<LINE>What majesty should be, what duty is,</LINE>
<LINE>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</LINE>
<LINE>Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</LINE>
<LINE>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</LINE>
<LINE>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</LINE>
<LINE>What is't but to be nothing else but mad?</LINE>
<LINE>But let that go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More matter, with less art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</LINE>
<LINE>That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;</LINE>
<LINE>And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;</LINE>
<LINE>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</LINE>
<LINE>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</LINE>
<LINE>That we find out the cause of this effect,</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</LINE>
<LINE>For this effect defective comes by cause:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.</LINE>
<LINE>I have a daughter--have while she is mine--</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most</LINE>
<LINE>beautified Ophelia,'--</LINE>
<LINE>That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is</LINE>
<LINE>a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Came this from Hamlet to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Doubt thou the stars are fire;</LINE>
<LINE>Doubt that the sun doth move;</LINE>
<LINE>Doubt truth to be a liar;</LINE>
<LINE>But never doubt I love.</LINE>
<LINE>'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;</LINE>
<LINE>I have not art to reckon my groans: but that</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</LINE>
<LINE>'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst</LINE>
<LINE>this machine is to him, HAMLET.'</LINE>
<LINE>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</LINE>
<LINE>And more above, hath his solicitings,</LINE>
<LINE>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</LINE>
<LINE>All given to mine ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how hath she</LINE>
<LINE>Received his love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you think of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As of a man faithful and honourable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</LINE>
<LINE>When I had seen this hot love on the wing--</LINE>
<LINE>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</LINE>
<LINE>Before my daughter told me--what might you,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</LINE>
<LINE>If I had play'd the desk or table-book,</LINE>
<LINE>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;</LINE>
<LINE>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</LINE>
<LINE>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</LINE>
<LINE>'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</LINE>
<LINE>This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,</LINE>
<LINE>That she should lock herself from his resort,</LINE>
<LINE>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</LINE>
<LINE>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</LINE>
<LINE>And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--</LINE>
<LINE>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</LINE>
<LINE>And all we mourn for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think 'tis this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be, very likely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--</LINE>
<LINE>That I have positively said 'Tis so,'</LINE>
<LINE>When it proved otherwise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Pointing to his head and shoulder</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</LINE>
<LINE>If circumstances lead me, I will find</LINE>
<LINE>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Within the centre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How may we try it further?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know, sometimes he walks four hours together</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the lobby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he does indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:</LINE>
<LINE>Be you and I behind an arras then;</LINE>
<LINE>Mark the encounter: if he love her not</LINE>
<LINE>And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be no assistant for a state,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep a farm and carters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will try it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, I do beseech you, both away:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll board him presently.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET, reading</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, give me leave:</LINE>
<LINE>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God-a-mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know me, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I would you were so honest a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honest, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</LINE>
<LINE>one man picked out of ten thousand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's very true, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a</LINE>
<LINE>god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a</LINE>
<LINE>blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.</LINE>
<LINE>Friend, look to 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  How say you by that? Still harping on my</LINE>
<LINE>daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I</LINE>
<LINE>was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and</LINE>
<LINE>truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for</LINE>
<LINE>love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.</LINE>
<LINE>What do you read, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Words, words, words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the matter, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Between who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here</LINE>
<LINE>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are</LINE>
<LINE>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</LINE>
<LINE>plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</LINE>
<LINE>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet</LINE>
<LINE>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for</LINE>
<LINE>yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab</LINE>
<LINE>you could go backward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Though this be madness, yet there is method</LINE>
<LINE>in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into my grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, that is out o' the air.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness</LINE>
<LINE>that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity</LINE>
<LINE>could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will</LINE>
<LINE>leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of</LINE>
<LINE>meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable</LINE>
<LINE>lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will</LINE>
<LINE>more willingly part withal: except my life, except</LINE>
<LINE>my life, except my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These tedious old fools!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>  God save you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honoured lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My most dear lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My excellent good friends! How dost thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the indifferent children of the earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy, in that we are not over-happy;</LINE>
<LINE>On fortune's cap we are not the very button.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor the soles of her shoe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of</LINE>
<LINE>her favours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, her privates we.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she</LINE>
<LINE>is a strumpet. What's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me question more in particular: what have you,</LINE>
<LINE>my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>that she sends you to prison hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prison, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Denmark's a prison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is the world one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly one; in which there are many confines,</LINE>
<LINE>wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We think not so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing</LINE>
<LINE>either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me</LINE>
<LINE>it is a prison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too</LINE>
<LINE>narrow for your mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count</LINE>
<LINE>myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I</LINE>
<LINE>have bad dreams.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very</LINE>
<LINE>substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dream itself is but a shadow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a</LINE>
<LINE>quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and</LINE>
<LINE>outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we</LINE>
<LINE>to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll wait upon you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest</LINE>
<LINE>of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest</LINE>
<LINE>man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the</LINE>
<LINE>beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I</LINE>
<LINE>thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are</LINE>
<LINE>too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it</LINE>
<LINE>your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,</LINE>
<LINE>deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should we say, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent</LINE>
<LINE>for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks</LINE>
<LINE>which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:</LINE>
<LINE>I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what end, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by</LINE>
<LINE>the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of</LINE>
<LINE>our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved</LINE>
<LINE>love, and by what more dear a better proposer could</LINE>
<LINE>charge you withal, be even and direct with me,</LINE>
<LINE>whether you were sent for, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>  What say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you</LINE>
<LINE>love me, hold not off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, we were sent for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</LINE>
<LINE>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king</LINE>
<LINE>and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but</LINE>
<LINE>wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all</LINE>
<LINE>custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily</LINE>
<LINE>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</LINE>
<LINE>earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most</LINE>
<LINE>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave</LINE>
<LINE>o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted</LINE>
<LINE>with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to</LINE>
<LINE>me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.</LINE>
<LINE>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!</LINE>
<LINE>how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how</LINE>
<LINE>express and admirable! in action how like an angel!</LINE>
<LINE>in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the</LINE>
<LINE>world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,</LINE>
<LINE>what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not</LINE>
<LINE>me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling</LINE>
<LINE>you seem to say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what</LINE>
<LINE>lenten entertainment the players shall receive from</LINE>
<LINE>you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they</LINE>
<LINE>coming, to offer you service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight</LINE>
<LINE>shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not</LINE>
<LINE>sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part</LINE>
<LINE>in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose</LINE>
<LINE>lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall</LINE>
<LINE>say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</LINE>
<LINE>for't. What players are they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even those you were wont to take delight in, the</LINE>
<LINE>tragedians of the city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How chances it they travel? their residence, both</LINE>
<LINE>in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the</LINE>
<LINE>late innovation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was</LINE>
<LINE>in the city? are they so followed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, indeed, are they not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but</LINE>
<LINE>there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,</LINE>
<LINE>that cry out on the top of question, and are most</LINE>
<LINE>tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the</LINE>
<LINE>fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they</LINE>
<LINE>call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of</LINE>
<LINE>goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are</LINE>
<LINE>they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no</LINE>
<LINE>longer than they can sing? will they not say</LINE>
<LINE>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</LINE>
<LINE>players--as it is most like, if their means are no</LINE>
<LINE>better--their writers do them wrong, to make them</LINE>
<LINE>exclaim against their own succession?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and</LINE>
<LINE>the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to</LINE>
<LINE>controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid</LINE>
<LINE>for argument, unless the poet and the player went to</LINE>
<LINE>cuffs in the question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do the boys carry it away?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of</LINE>
<LINE>Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while</LINE>
<LINE>my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an</LINE>
<LINE>hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.</LINE>
<LINE>'Sblood, there is something in this more than</LINE>
<LINE>natural, if philosophy could find it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish of trumpets within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There are the players.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,</LINE>
<LINE>come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion</LINE>
<LINE>and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,</LINE>
<LINE>lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,</LINE>
<LINE>must show fairly outward, should more appear like</LINE>
<LINE>entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my</LINE>
<LINE>uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what, my dear lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is</LINE>
<LINE>southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well be with you, gentlemen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a</LINE>
<LINE>hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet</LINE>
<LINE>out of his swaddling-clouts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happily he's the second time come to them; for they</LINE>
<LINE>say an old man is twice a child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;</LINE>
<LINE>mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;</LINE>
<LINE>'twas so indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have news to tell you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have news to tell you.</LINE>
<LINE>When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The actors are come hither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Buz, buz!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon mine honour,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then came each actor on his ass,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,</LINE>
<LINE>comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,</LINE>
<LINE>historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-</LINE>
<LINE>comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or</LINE>
<LINE>poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor</LINE>
<LINE>Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the</LINE>
<LINE>liberty, these are the only men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a treasure had he, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why,</LINE>
<LINE>'One fair daughter and no more,</LINE>
<LINE>The which he loved passing well.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Still on my daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter</LINE>
<LINE>that I love passing well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that follows not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What follows, then, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why,</LINE>
<LINE>'As by lot, God wot,'</LINE>
<LINE>and then, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--</LINE>
<LINE>the first row of the pious chanson will show you</LINE>
<LINE>more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter four or five Players</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad</LINE>
<LINE>to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old</LINE>
<LINE>friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:</LINE>
<LINE>comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young</LINE>
<LINE>lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is</LINE>
<LINE>nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the</LINE>
<LINE>altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like</LINE>
<LINE>apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the</LINE>
<LINE>ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en</LINE>
<LINE>to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:</LINE>
<LINE>we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste</LINE>
<LINE>of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What speech, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</LINE>
<LINE>never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the</LINE>
<LINE>play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas</LINE>
<LINE>caviare to the general: but it was--as I received</LINE>
<LINE>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters</LINE>
<LINE>cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well</LINE>
<LINE>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</LINE>
<LINE>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</LINE>
<LINE>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</LINE>
<LINE>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</LINE>
<LINE>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</LINE>
<LINE>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</LINE>
<LINE>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</LINE>
<LINE>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and</LINE>
<LINE>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</LINE>
<LINE>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</LINE>
<LINE>at this line: let me see, let me see--</LINE>
<LINE>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--</LINE>
<LINE>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--</LINE>
<LINE>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</LINE>
<LINE>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</LINE>
<LINE>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</LINE>
<LINE>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</LINE>
<LINE>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</LINE>
<LINE>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</LINE>
<LINE>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</LINE>
<LINE>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'</LINE>
<LINE>So, proceed you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and</LINE>
<LINE>good discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Anon he finds him</LINE>
<LINE>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</LINE>
<LINE>Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</LINE>
<LINE>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</LINE>
<LINE>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</LINE>
<LINE>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</LINE>
<LINE>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was declining on the milky head</LINE>
<LINE>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</LINE>
<LINE>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a neutral to his will and matter,</LINE>
<LINE>Did nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>But, as we often see, against some storm,</LINE>
<LINE>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</LINE>
<LINE>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</LINE>
<LINE>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,</LINE>
<LINE>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</LINE>
<LINE>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</LINE>
<LINE>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</LINE>
<LINE>With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</LINE>
<LINE>Now falls on Priam.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</LINE>
<LINE>In general synod 'take away her power;</LINE>
<LINE>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</LINE>
<LINE>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>As low as to the fiends!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is too long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he</LINE>
<LINE>sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'The mobled queen?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames</LINE>
<LINE>With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head</LINE>
<LINE>Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,</LINE>
<LINE>About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,</LINE>
<LINE>A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;</LINE>
<LINE>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have</LINE>
<LINE>pronounced:</LINE>
<LINE>But if the gods themselves did see her then</LINE>
<LINE>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</LINE>
<LINE>In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>The instant burst of clamour that she made,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless things mortal move them not at all,</LINE>
<LINE>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And passion in the gods.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has</LINE>
<LINE>tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.</LINE>
<LINE>Good my lord, will you see the players well</LINE>
<LINE>bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for</LINE>
<LINE>they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the</LINE>
<LINE>time: after your death you were better have a bad</LINE>
<LINE>epitaph than their ill report while you live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man</LINE>
<LINE>after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?</LINE>
<LINE>Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less</LINE>
<LINE>they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.</LINE>
<LINE>Take them in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, sirs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the</LINE>
<LINE>Murder of Gonzago?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,</LINE>
<LINE>study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which</LINE>
<LINE>I would set down and insert in't, could you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him</LINE>
<LINE>not.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit First Player</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are</LINE>
<LINE>welcome to Elsinore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, so, God be wi' ye;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now I am alone.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</LINE>
<LINE>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</LINE>
<LINE>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</LINE>
<LINE>That from her working all his visage wann'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</LINE>
<LINE>With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</LINE>
<LINE>For Hecuba!</LINE>
<LINE>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should weep for her? What would he do,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</LINE>
<LINE>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</LINE>
<LINE>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</LINE>
<LINE>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</LINE>
<LINE>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</LINE>
<LINE>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</LINE>
<LINE>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</LINE>
<LINE>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</LINE>
<LINE>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose property and most dear life</LINE>
<LINE>A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</LINE>
<LINE>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?</LINE>
<LINE>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?</LINE>
<LINE>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,</LINE>
<LINE>As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?</LINE>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall</LINE>
<LINE>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</LINE>
<LINE>I should have fatted all the region kites</LINE>
<LINE>With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!</LINE>
<LINE>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</LINE>
<LINE>O, vengeance!</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,</LINE>
<LINE>A scullion!</LINE>
<LINE>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</LINE>
<LINE>Have by the very cunning of the scene</LINE>
<LINE>Been struck so to the soul that presently</LINE>
<LINE>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;</LINE>
<LINE>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</LINE>
<LINE>With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players</LINE>
<LINE>Play something like the murder of my father</LINE>
<LINE>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</LINE>
<LINE>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>May be the devil: and the devil hath power</LINE>
<LINE>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is very potent with such spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds</LINE>
<LINE>More relative than this: the play 's the thing</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  A room in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,
OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</LINE>
<LINE>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</LINE>
<LINE>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</LINE>
<LINE>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He does confess he feels himself distracted;</LINE>
<LINE>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</LINE>
<LINE>But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>When we would bring him on to some confession</LINE>
<LINE>Of his true state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he receive you well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like a gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But with much forcing of his disposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</LINE>
<LINE>Most free in his reply.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you assay him?</LINE>
<LINE>To any pastime?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</LINE>
<LINE>We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;</LINE>
<LINE>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</LINE>
<LINE>To hear of it: they are about the court,</LINE>
<LINE>And, as I think, they have already order</LINE>
<LINE>This night to play before him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis most true:</LINE>
<LINE>And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties</LINE>
<LINE>To hear and see the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart; and it doth much content me</LINE>
<LINE>To hear him so inclined.</LINE>
<LINE>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</LINE>
<LINE>And drive his purpose on to these delights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</LINE>
<LINE>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</LINE>
<LINE>That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</LINE>
<LINE>Affront Ophelia:</LINE>
<LINE>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</LINE>
<LINE>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,</LINE>
<LINE>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</LINE>
<LINE>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</LINE>
<LINE>If 't be the affliction of his love or no</LINE>
<LINE>That thus he suffers for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall obey you.</LINE>
<LINE>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</LINE>
<LINE>That your good beauties be the happy cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</LINE>
<LINE>To both your honours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I wish it may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,</LINE>
<LINE>We will bestow ourselves.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To OPHELIA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Read on this book;</LINE>
<LINE>That show of such an exercise may colour</LINE>
<LINE>Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage</LINE>
<LINE>And pious action we do sugar o'er</LINE>
<LINE>The devil himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>          O, 'tis too true!</LINE>
<LINE>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</LINE>
<LINE>The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,</LINE>
<LINE>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</LINE>
<LINE>Than is my deed to my most painted word:</LINE>
<LINE>O heavy burthen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</LINE>
<LINE>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</LINE>
<LINE>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</LINE>
<LINE>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</LINE>
<LINE>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</LINE>
<LINE>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</LINE>
<LINE>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</LINE>
<LINE>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</LINE>
<LINE>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</LINE>
<LINE>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</LINE>
<LINE>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</LINE>
<LINE>Must give us pause: there's the respect</LINE>
<LINE>That makes calamity of so long life;</LINE>
<LINE>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</LINE>
<LINE>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</LINE>
<LINE>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</LINE>
<LINE>The insolence of office and the spurns</LINE>
<LINE>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</LINE>
<LINE>When he himself might his quietus make</LINE>
<LINE>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</LINE>
<LINE>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the dread of something after death,</LINE>
<LINE>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</LINE>
<LINE>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</LINE>
<LINE>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</LINE>
<LINE>Than fly to others that we know not of?</LINE>
<LINE>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</LINE>
<LINE>And thus the native hue of resolution</LINE>
<LINE>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And enterprises of great pith and moment</LINE>
<LINE>With this regard their currents turn awry,</LINE>
<LINE>And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!</LINE>
<LINE>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</LINE>
<LINE>Be all my sins remember'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>How does your honour for this many a day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have longed long to re-deliver;</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, now receive them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not I;</LINE>
<LINE>I never gave you aught.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;</LINE>
<LINE>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed</LINE>
<LINE>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</LINE>
<LINE>Take these again; for to the noble mind</LINE>
<LINE>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</LINE>
<LINE>There, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ha! are you honest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you fair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means your lordship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should</LINE>
<LINE>admit no discourse to your beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than</LINE>
<LINE>with honesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner</LINE>
<LINE>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</LINE>
<LINE>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</LINE>
<LINE>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</LINE>
<LINE>time gives it proof. I did love you once.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot</LINE>
<LINE>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of</LINE>
<LINE>it: I loved you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was the more deceived.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a</LINE>
<LINE>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;</LINE>
<LINE>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</LINE>
<LINE>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very</LINE>
<LINE>proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at</LINE>
<LINE>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,</LINE>
<LINE>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them</LINE>
<LINE>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</LINE>
<LINE>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,</LINE>
<LINE>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's your father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At home, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the</LINE>
<LINE>fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, help him, you sweet heavens!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for</LINE>
<LINE>thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</LINE>
<LINE>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</LINE>
<LINE>nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs</LINE>
<LINE>marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough</LINE>
<LINE>what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,</LINE>
<LINE>and quickly too. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heavenly powers, restore him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God</LINE>
<LINE>has given you one face, and you make yourselves</LINE>
<LINE>another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and</LINE>
<LINE>nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness</LINE>
<LINE>your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath</LINE>
<LINE>made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:</LINE>
<LINE>those that are married already, all but one, shall</LINE>
<LINE>live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a</LINE>
<LINE>nunnery, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</LINE>
<LINE>The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;</LINE>
<LINE>The expectancy and rose of the fair state,</LINE>
<LINE>The glass of fashion and the mould of form,</LINE>
<LINE>The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!</LINE>
<LINE>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,</LINE>
<LINE>That suck'd the honey of his music vows,</LINE>
<LINE>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;</LINE>
<LINE>That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth</LINE>
<LINE>Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,</LINE>
<LINE>To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love! his affections do not that way tend;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,</LINE>
<LINE>Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;</LINE>
<LINE>And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose</LINE>
<LINE>Will be some danger: which for to prevent,</LINE>
<LINE>I have in quick determination</LINE>
<LINE>Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,</LINE>
<LINE>For the demand of our neglected tribute</LINE>
<LINE>Haply the seas and countries different</LINE>
<LINE>With variable objects shall expel</LINE>
<LINE>This something-settled matter in his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</LINE>
<LINE>From fashion of himself. What think you on't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall do well: but yet do I believe</LINE>
<LINE>The origin and commencement of his grief</LINE>
<LINE>Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!</LINE>
<LINE>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;</LINE>
<LINE>We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;</LINE>
<LINE>But, if you hold it fit, after the play</LINE>
<LINE>Let his queen mother all alone entreat him</LINE>
<LINE>To show his grief: let her be round with him;</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear</LINE>
<LINE>Of all their conference. If she find him not,</LINE>
<LINE>To England send him, or confine him where</LINE>
<LINE>Your wisdom best shall think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be so:</LINE>
<LINE>Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A hall in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET and Players</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</LINE>
<LINE>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</LINE>
<LINE>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</LINE>
<LINE>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</LINE>
<LINE>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</LINE>
<LINE>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</LINE>
<LINE>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</LINE>
<LINE>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</LINE>
<LINE>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</LINE>
<LINE>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</LINE>
<LINE>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</LINE>
<LINE>for the most part are capable of nothing but</LINE>
<LINE>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such</LINE>
<LINE>a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it</LINE>
<LINE>out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant your honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion</LINE>
<LINE>be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the</LINE>
<LINE>word to the action; with this special o'erstep not</LINE>
<LINE>the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is</LINE>
<LINE>from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the</LINE>
<LINE>first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the</LINE>
<LINE>mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,</LINE>
<LINE>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of</LINE>
<LINE>the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,</LINE>
<LINE>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful</LINE>
<LINE>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the</LINE>
<LINE>censure of the which one must in your allowance</LINE>
<LINE>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be</LINE>
<LINE>players that I have seen play, and heard others</LINE>
<LINE>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,</LINE>
<LINE>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor</LINE>
<LINE>the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so</LINE>
<LINE>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of</LINE>
<LINE>nature's journeymen had made men and not made them</LINE>
<LINE>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,</LINE>
<LINE>sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, reform it altogether. And let those that play</LINE>
<LINE>your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;</LINE>
<LINE>for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to</LINE>
<LINE>set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh</LINE>
<LINE>too; though, in the mean time, some necessary</LINE>
<LINE>question of the play be then to be considered:</LINE>
<LINE>that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition</LINE>
<LINE>in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Players</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the queen too, and that presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid the players make haste.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Will you two help to hasten them?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will, my lord.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ho! Horatio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORATIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, sweet lord, at your service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man</LINE>
<LINE>As e'er my conversation coped withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my dear lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, do not think I flatter;</LINE>
<LINE>For what advancement may I hope from thee</LINE>
<LINE>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?</LINE>
<LINE>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,</LINE>
<LINE>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</LINE>
<LINE>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</LINE>
<LINE>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</LINE>
<LINE>And could of men distinguish, her election</LINE>
<LINE>Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been</LINE>
<LINE>As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>A man that fortune's buffets and rewards</LINE>
<LINE>Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those</LINE>
<LINE>Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,</LINE>
<LINE>That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger</LINE>
<LINE>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man</LINE>
<LINE>That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him</LINE>
<LINE>In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,</LINE>
<LINE>As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--</LINE>
<LINE>There is a play to-night before the king;</LINE>
<LINE>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have told thee of my father's death:</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the very comment of thy soul</LINE>
<LINE>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt</LINE>
<LINE>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</LINE>
<LINE>And my imaginations are as foul</LINE>
<LINE>As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;</LINE>
<LINE>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</LINE>
<LINE>And after we will both our judgments join</LINE>
<LINE>In censure of his seeming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are coming to the play; I must be idle:</LINE>
<LINE>Get you a place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares our cousin Hamlet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat</LINE>
<LINE>the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words</LINE>
<LINE>are not mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor mine now.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What did you enact?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the</LINE>
<LINE>Capitol; Brutus killed me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf</LINE>
<LINE>there. Be the players ready?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</LINE>

<LINE>That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are merry, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do</LINE>
<LINE>but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my</LINE>
<LINE>mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two</LINE>
<LINE>months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's</LINE>
<LINE>hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half</LINE>
<LINE>a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,</LINE>
<LINE>then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with</LINE>
<LINE>the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,</LINE>
<LINE>the hobby-horse is forgot.'</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen
embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes
show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,
and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down
upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's
ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with
gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but
in the end accepts his love</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike this show imports the argument of the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prologue</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot</LINE>
<LINE>keep counsel; they'll tell all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will he tell us what this show meant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you</LINE>
<LINE>ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Prologue</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For us, and for our tragedy,</LINE>
<LINE>Here stooping to your clemency,</LINE>
<LINE>We beg your hearing patiently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis brief, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As woman's love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Players, King and Queen</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player King</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round</LINE>
<LINE>Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen</LINE>
<LINE>About the world have times twelve thirties been,</LINE>
<LINE>Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands</LINE>
<LINE>Unite commutual in most sacred bands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player Queen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So many journeys may the sun and moon</LINE>
<LINE>Make us again count o'er ere love be done!</LINE>
<LINE>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,</LINE>
<LINE>So far from cheer and from your former state,</LINE>
<LINE>That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,</LINE>
<LINE>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:</LINE>
<LINE>For women's fear and love holds quantity;</LINE>
<LINE>In neither aught, or in extremity.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;</LINE>
<LINE>And as my love is sized, my fear is so:</LINE>
<LINE>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player King</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;</LINE>
<LINE>My operant powers their functions leave to do:</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,</LINE>
<LINE>Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind</LINE>
<LINE>For husband shalt thou--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player Queen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, confound the rest!</LINE>
<LINE>Such love must needs be treason in my breast:</LINE>
<LINE>In second husband let me be accurst!</LINE>
<LINE>None wed the second but who kill'd the first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Wormwood, wormwood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player Queen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The instances that second marriage move</LINE>
<LINE>Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:</LINE>
<LINE>A second time I kill my husband dead,</LINE>
<LINE>When second husband kisses me in bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player King</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do believe you think what now you speak;</LINE>
<LINE>But what we do determine oft we break.</LINE>
<LINE>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Of violent birth, but poor validity;</LINE>
<LINE>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;</LINE>
<LINE>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.</LINE>
<LINE>Most necessary 'tis that we forget</LINE>
<LINE>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:</LINE>
<LINE>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</LINE>
<LINE>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</LINE>
<LINE>The violence of either grief or joy</LINE>
<LINE>Their own enactures with themselves destroy:</LINE>
<LINE>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</LINE>
<LINE>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</LINE>
<LINE>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange</LINE>
<LINE>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</LINE>
<LINE>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;</LINE>
<LINE>The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;</LINE>
<LINE>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,</LINE>
<LINE>Directly seasons him his enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>But, orderly to end where I begun,</LINE>
<LINE>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</LINE>
<LINE>That our devices still are overthrown;</LINE>
<LINE>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:</LINE>
<LINE>So think thou wilt no second husband wed;</LINE>
<LINE>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player Queen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!</LINE>
<LINE>Sport and repose lock from me day and night!</LINE>
<LINE>To desperation turn my trust and hope!</LINE>
<LINE>An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!</LINE>
<LINE>Each opposite that blanks the face of joy</LINE>
<LINE>Meet what I would have well and it destroy!</LINE>
<LINE>Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,</LINE>
<LINE>If, once a widow, ever I be wife!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she should break it now!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player King</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;</LINE>
<LINE>My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile</LINE>
<LINE>The tedious day with sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sleeps</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Player Queen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sleep rock thy brain,</LINE>
<LINE>And never come mischance between us twain!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, how like you this play?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The lady protests too much, methinks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, but she'll keep her word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence</LINE>
<LINE>i' the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you call the play?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play</LINE>
<LINE>is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is</LINE>
<LINE>the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see</LINE>
<LINE>anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'</LINE>
<LINE>that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it</LINE>
<LINE>touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our</LINE>
<LINE>withers are unwrung.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LUCIANUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are as good as a chorus, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could interpret between you and your love, if I</LINE>
<LINE>could see the puppets dallying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are keen, my lord, you are keen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still better, and worse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;</LINE>
<LINE>pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:</LINE>
<LINE>'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;</LINE>
<LINE>Confederate season, else no creature seeing;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,</LINE>
<LINE>With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy natural magic and dire property,</LINE>
<LINE>On wholesome life usurp immediately.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His</LINE>
<LINE>name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in</LINE>
<LINE>choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer</LINE>
<LINE>gets the love of Gonzago's wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPHELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king rises.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, frighted with false fire!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give o'er the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me some light: away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lights, lights, lights!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, let the stricken deer go weep,</LINE>
<LINE>The hart ungalled play;</LINE>
<LINE>For some must watch, while some must sleep:</LINE>
<LINE>So runs the world away.</LINE>
<LINE>Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if</LINE>
<LINE>the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two</LINE>
<LINE>Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a</LINE>
<LINE>fellowship in a cry of players, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Half a share.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A whole one, I.</LINE>
<LINE>For thou dost know, O Damon dear,</LINE>
<LINE>This realm dismantled was</LINE>
<LINE>Of Jove himself; and now reigns here</LINE>
<LINE>A very, very--pajock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You might have rhymed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a</LINE>
<LINE>thousand pound. Didst perceive?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon the talk of the poisoning?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did very well note him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!</LINE>
<LINE>For if the king like not the comedy,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, some music!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, a whole history.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king, sir,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With drink, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, rather with choler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your wisdom should show itself more richer to</LINE>
<LINE>signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him</LINE>
<LINE>to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far</LINE>
<LINE>more choler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and</LINE>
<LINE>start not so wildly from my affair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am tame, sir: pronounce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of</LINE>
<LINE>spirit, hath sent me to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right</LINE>
<LINE>breed. If it shall please you to make me a</LINE>
<LINE>wholesome answer, I will do your mother's</LINE>
<LINE>commandment: if not, your pardon and my return</LINE>
<LINE>shall be the end of my business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;</LINE>
<LINE>or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no</LINE>
<LINE>more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her</LINE>
<LINE>into amazement and admiration.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But</LINE>
<LINE>is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's</LINE>
<LINE>admiration? Impart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you</LINE>
<LINE>go to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have</LINE>
<LINE>you any further trade with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you once did love me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you</LINE>
<LINE>do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if</LINE>
<LINE>you deny your griefs to your friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I lack advancement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can that be, when you have the voice of the king</LINE>
<LINE>himself for your succession in Denmark?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb</LINE>
<LINE>is something musty.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Players with recorders</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with</LINE>
<LINE>you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,</LINE>
<LINE>as if you would drive me into a toil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too</LINE>
<LINE>unmannerly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not well understand that. Will you play upon</LINE>
<LINE>this pipe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, I cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know no touch of it, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with</LINE>
<LINE>your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your</LINE>
<LINE>mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.</LINE>
<LINE>Look you, these are the stops.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But these cannot I command to any utterance of</LINE>
<LINE>harmony; I have not the skill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of</LINE>
<LINE>me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know</LINE>
<LINE>my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my</LINE>
<LINE>mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to</LINE>
<LINE>the top of my compass: and there is much music,</LINE>
<LINE>excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot</LINE>
<LINE>you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am</LINE>
<LINE>easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what</LINE>
<LINE>instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you</LINE>
<LINE>cannot play upon me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>God bless you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the queen would speak with you, and</LINE>
<LINE>presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks it is like a weasel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is backed like a weasel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or like a whale?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very like a whale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool</LINE>
<LINE>me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By and by is easily said.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Leave me, friends.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but HAMLET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Tis now the very witching time of night,</LINE>
<LINE>When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out</LINE>
<LINE>Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And do such bitter business as the day</LINE>
<LINE>Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.</LINE>
<LINE>O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever</LINE>
<LINE>The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be cruel, not unnatural:</LINE>
<LINE>I will speak daggers to her, but use none;</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;</LINE>
<LINE>How in my words soever she be shent,</LINE>
<LINE>To give them seals never, my soul, consent!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like him not, nor stands it safe with us</LINE>
<LINE>To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;</LINE>
<LINE>I your commission will forthwith dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>And he to England shall along with you:</LINE>

<LINE>Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his lunacies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUILDENSTERN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will ourselves provide:</LINE>
<LINE>Most holy and religious fear it is</LINE>
<LINE>To keep those many many bodies safe</LINE>
<LINE>That live and feed upon your majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The single and peculiar life is bound,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the strength and armour of the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep itself from noyance; but much more</LINE>
<LINE>That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest</LINE>

<LINE>What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,</LINE>
<LINE>Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,</LINE>
<LINE>To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things</LINE>
<LINE>Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,</LINE>
<LINE>Each small annexment, petty consequence,</LINE>
<LINE>Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone</LINE>
<LINE>Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:</LINE>
<LINE>Behind the arras I'll convey myself,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:</LINE>
<LINE>And, as you said, and wisely was it said,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear</LINE>
<LINE>The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell you what I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, dear my lord.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</LINE>
<LINE>A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</LINE>
<LINE>Though inclination be as sharp as will:</LINE>
<LINE>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a man to double business bound,</LINE>
<LINE>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</LINE>
<LINE>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</LINE>
<LINE>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</LINE>
<LINE>But to confront the visage of offence?</LINE>
<LINE>And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,</LINE>
<LINE>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</LINE>
<LINE>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</LINE>
<LINE>Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of those effects for which I did the murder,</LINE>
<LINE>My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</LINE>
<LINE>May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?</LINE>
<LINE>In the corrupted currents of this world</LINE>
<LINE>Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,</LINE>
<LINE>And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself</LINE>
<LINE>Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;</LINE>
<LINE>There is no shuffling, there the action lies</LINE>
<LINE>In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</LINE>
<LINE>To give in evidence. What then? what rests?</LINE>
<LINE>Try what repentance can: what can it not?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet what can it when one can not repent?</LINE>
<LINE>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</LINE>
<LINE>O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</LINE>
<LINE>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!</LINE>
<LINE>Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!</LINE>
<LINE>All may be well.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;</LINE>
<LINE>And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:</LINE>
<LINE>A villain kills my father; and for that,</LINE>
<LINE>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</LINE>
<LINE>To heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>He took my father grossly, full of bread;</LINE>
<LINE>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</LINE>
<LINE>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?</LINE>
<LINE>But in our circumstance and course of thought,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,</LINE>
<LINE>To take him in the purging of his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>When he is fit and season'd for his passage?</LINE>
<LINE>No!</LINE>
<LINE>Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:</LINE>
<LINE>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;</LINE>
<LINE>At gaming, swearing, or about some act</LINE>
<LINE>That has no relish of salvation in't;</LINE>
<LINE>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his soul may be as damn'd and black</LINE>
<LINE>As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:</LINE>
<LINE>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, I know not:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,</LINE>
<LINE>As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</LINE>

<LINE>As kill a king!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.</LINE>
<LINE>Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,</LINE>
<LINE>If it be made of penetrable stuff,</LINE>
<LINE>If damned custom have not brass'd it so</LINE>
<LINE>That it is proof and bulwark against sense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>In noise so rude against me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such an act</LINE>
<LINE>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</LINE>
<LINE>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</LINE>
<LINE>And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows</LINE>
<LINE>As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed</LINE>
<LINE>As from the body of contraction plucks</LINE>
<LINE>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</LINE>
<LINE>A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</LINE>
<LINE>With tristful visage, as against the doom,</LINE>
<LINE>Is thought-sick at the act.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me, what act,</LINE>
<LINE>That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</LINE>
<LINE>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</LINE>
<LINE>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</LINE>
<LINE>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</LINE>
<LINE>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</LINE>
<LINE>A station like the herald Mercury</LINE>
<LINE>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</LINE>
<LINE>A combination and a form indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</LINE>
<LINE>To give the world assurance of a man:</LINE>
<LINE>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</LINE>
<LINE>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</LINE>
<LINE>And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot call it love; for at your age</LINE>
<LINE>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</LINE>
<LINE>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</LINE>
<LINE>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</LINE>
<LINE>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</LINE>
<LINE>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</LINE>
<LINE>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</LINE>
<LINE>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</LINE>
<LINE>That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</LINE>
<LINE>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</LINE>
<LINE>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</LINE>
<LINE>Could not so mope.</LINE>
<LINE>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</LINE>
<LINE>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</LINE>
<LINE>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</LINE>
<LINE>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Since frost itself as actively doth burn</LINE>
<LINE>And reason panders will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Hamlet, speak no more:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And there I see such black and grained spots</LINE>
<LINE>As will not leave their tinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but to live</LINE>
<LINE>In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love</LINE>
<LINE>Over the nasty sty,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, speak to me no more;</LINE>
<LINE>These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;</LINE>
<LINE>No more, sweet Hamlet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A murderer and a villain;</LINE>
<LINE>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe</LINE>
<LINE>Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;</LINE>
<LINE>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</LINE>
<LINE>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,</LINE>
<LINE>And put it in his pocket!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,</LINE>
<LINE>You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, he's mad!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</LINE>
<LINE>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by</LINE>
<LINE>The important acting of your dread command? O, say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ghost</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not forget: this visitation</LINE>
<LINE>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:</LINE>
<LINE>O, step between her and her fighting soul:</LINE>
<LINE>Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to her, Hamlet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it with you, lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, how is't with you,</LINE>
<LINE>That you do bend your eye on vacancy</LINE>
<LINE>And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?</LINE>
<LINE>Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,</LINE>
<LINE>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</LINE>
<LINE>Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</LINE>
<LINE>Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!</LINE>
<LINE>His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest with this piteous action you convert</LINE>
<LINE>My stern effects: then what I have to do</LINE>
<LINE>Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To whom do you speak this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you see nothing there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor did you nothing hear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nothing but ourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!</LINE>
<LINE>My father, in his habit as he lived!</LINE>
<LINE>Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This the very coinage of your brain:</LINE>
<LINE>This bodiless creation ecstasy</LINE>
<LINE>Is very cunning in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ecstasy!</LINE>
<LINE>My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes as healthful music: it is not madness</LINE>
<LINE>That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,</LINE>
<LINE>And I the matter will re-word; which madness</LINE>
<LINE>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:</LINE>
<LINE>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,</LINE>
<LINE>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;</LINE>
<LINE>And do not spread the compost on the weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;</LINE>
<LINE>For in the fatness of these pursy times</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, throw away the worser part of it,</LINE>
<LINE>And live the purer with the other half.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</LINE>
<LINE>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</LINE>
<LINE>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</LINE>
<LINE>That to the use of actions fair and good</LINE>
<LINE>He likewise gives a frock or livery,</LINE>
<LINE>That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</LINE>
<LINE>To the next abstinence: the next more easy;</LINE>
<LINE>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>And either ... the devil, or throw him out</LINE>
<LINE>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:</LINE>
<LINE>And when you are desirous to be bless'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Pointing to POLONIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,</LINE>
<LINE>To punish me with this and this with me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I must be their scourge and minister.</LINE>
<LINE>I will bestow him, and will answer well</LINE>
<LINE>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</LINE>
<LINE>I must be cruel, only to be kind:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</LINE>
<LINE>One word more, good lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:</LINE>
<LINE>Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;</LINE>
<LINE>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</LINE>
<LINE>Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>Make you to ravel all this matter out,</LINE>
<LINE>That I essentially am not in madness,</LINE>
<LINE>But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;</LINE>
<LINE>For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</LINE>
<LINE>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</LINE>
<LINE>Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?</LINE>
<LINE>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</LINE>
<LINE>Unpeg the basket on the house's top.</LINE>
<LINE>Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,</LINE>
<LINE>To try conclusions, in the basket creep,</LINE>
<LINE>And break your own neck down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,</LINE>
<LINE>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe</LINE>
<LINE>What thou hast said to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must to England; you know that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack,</LINE>
<LINE>I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,</LINE>
<LINE>They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,</LINE>
<LINE>And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis the sport to have the engineer</LINE>
<LINE>Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard</LINE>
<LINE>But I will delve one yard below their mines,</LINE>
<LINE>And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</LINE>
<LINE>This man shall set me packing:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.</LINE>
<LINE>Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor</LINE>
<LINE>Is now most still, most secret and most grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was in life a foolish prating knave.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night, mother.</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?</LINE>

<LINE>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</LINE>

<LINE>Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Friends both, go join you with some further aid:</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</LINE>
<LINE>And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:</LINE>
<LINE>Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body</LINE>
<LINE>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;</LINE>
<LINE>And let them know, both what we mean to do,</LINE>
<LINE>And what's untimely done...</LINE>
<LINE>Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,</LINE>
<LINE>As level as the cannon to his blank,</LINE>
<LINE>Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Believe what?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his</LINE>
<LINE>rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the</LINE>
<LINE>king best service in the end: he keeps them, like</LINE>
<LINE>an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to</LINE>
<LINE>be last swallowed: when he needs what you have</LINE>
<LINE>gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you</LINE>
<LINE>shall be dry again.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSENCRANTZ</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand you not, my lord.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The body is with the king, but the king is not with</LINE>

<LINE>I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.</LINE>
<LINE>How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet must not we put the strong law on him:</LINE>
<LINE>He's loved of the distracted multitude,</LINE>
<LINE>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,</LINE>
<LINE>But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,</LINE>
<LINE>This sudden sending him away must seem</LINE>
<LINE>Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown</LINE>
<LINE>By desperate appliance are relieved,</LINE>
<LINE>Or not at all.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSENCRANTZ</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! what hath befall'n?</LINE>

<LINE>At supper! where?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain</LINE>
<LINE>convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your</LINE>
<LINE>worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all</LINE>
<LINE>creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for</LINE>
<LINE>maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but</LINE>
<LINE>variable service, two dishes, but to one table:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Or for some frontier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly to speak, and with no addition,</LINE>
<LINE>We go to gain a little patch of ground</LINE>
<LINE>That hath in it no profit but the name.</LINE>
<LINE>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</LINE>
<LINE>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</LINE>

<LINE>Yes, it is already garrison'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</LINE>
<LINE>Will not debate the question of this straw:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,</LINE>
<LINE>That inward breaks, and shows no cause without</LINE>
<LINE>Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>I'll be with you straight go a little before.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all except HAMLET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How all occasions do inform against me,</LINE>
<LINE>And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,</LINE>
<LINE>If his chief good and market of his time</LINE>
<LINE>Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.</LINE>
<LINE>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking before and after, gave us not</LINE>
<LINE>That capability and god-like reason</LINE>
<LINE>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</LINE>
<LINE>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</LINE>
<LINE>Of thinking too precisely on the event,</LINE>
<LINE>A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom</LINE>
<LINE>And ever three parts coward, I do not know</LINE>
<LINE>Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'</LINE>
<LINE>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</LINE>
<LINE>To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</LINE>
<LINE>Witness this army of such mass and charge</LINE>
<LINE>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd</LINE>
<LINE>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</LINE>
<LINE>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</LINE>
<LINE>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</LINE>
<LINE>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</LINE>
<LINE>Is not to stir without great argument,</LINE>
<LINE>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</LINE>
<LINE>When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,</LINE>
<LINE>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see</LINE>
<LINE>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</LINE>
<LINE>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is not tomb enough and continent</LINE>
<LINE>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She speaks much of her father; says she hears</LINE>
<LINE>There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</LINE>
<LINE>The hearers to collection; they aim at it,</LINE>
<LINE>And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures</LINE>
<LINE>yield them,</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed would make one think there might be thought,</LINE>
<LINE>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit HORATIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,</LINE>

<LINE>O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs</LINE>

<LINE>When sorrows come, they come not single spies</LINE>
<LINE>But in battalions. First, her father slain:</LINE>
<LINE>Next, your son gone; and he most violent author</LINE>
<LINE>Of his own just remove: the people muddied,</LINE>
<LINE>Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,</LINE>
<LINE>For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,</LINE>
<LINE>In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia</LINE>
<LINE>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:</LINE>
<LINE>Last, and as much containing as all these,</LINE>
<LINE>Her brother is in secret come from France;</LINE>
<LINE>Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>And wants not buzzers to infect his ear</LINE>
<LINE>With pestilent speeches of his father's death;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Will nothing stick our person to arraign</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Calmly, good Laertes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot</LINE>
<LINE>Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow</LINE>
<LINE>Of my true mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the cause, Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?</LINE>
<LINE>Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:</LINE>
<LINE>There's such divinity doth hedge a king,</LINE>
<LINE>That treason can but peep to what it would,</LINE>
<LINE>Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, man.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is my father?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:</LINE>
<LINE>To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!</LINE>
<LINE>Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!</LINE>
<LINE>I dare damnation. To this point I stand,</LINE>
<LINE>That both the worlds I give to negligence,</LINE>
<LINE>Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged</LINE>
<LINE>Most thoroughly for my father.</LINE>

<LINE>Good Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>If you desire to know the certainty</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, now you speak</LINE>
<LINE>Like a good child and a true gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>That I am guiltless of your father's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And am most sensible in grief for it,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall as level to your judgment pierce</LINE>

<LINE>Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!</LINE>

<LINE>Laertes, I must commune with your grief,</LINE>

<LINE>If by direct or by collateral hand</LINE>
<LINE>They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,</LINE>

<LINE>He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked</LINE>
<LINE>this, give these fellows some means to the king:</LINE>
<LINE>they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old</LINE>
<LINE>at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us</LINE>
<LINE>chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on</LINE>
<LINE>a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded</LINE>
<LINE>them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so</LINE>
<LINE>I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with</LINE>
<LINE>me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they</LINE>
<LINE>did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king</LINE>
<LINE>have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me</LINE>
<LINE>with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I</LINE>
<LINE>have words to speak in thine ear will make thee</LINE>
<LINE>dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of</LINE>
<LINE>the matter. These good fellows will bring thee</LINE>
<LINE>where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their</LINE>
<LINE>course for England: of them I have much to tell</LINE>
<LINE>thee. Farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'</LINE>
<LINE>Come, I will make you way for these your letters;</LINE>
<LINE>And do't the speedier, that you may direct me</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  Another room in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</LINE>
<LINE>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which hath your noble father slain</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It well appears: but tell me</LINE>
<LINE>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</LINE>
<LINE>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</LINE>
<LINE>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</LINE>
<LINE>You mainly were stirr'd up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, for two special reasons;</LINE>
<LINE>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</LINE>
<LINE>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--</LINE>
<LINE>My virtue or my plague, be it either which--</LINE>
<LINE>She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</LINE>
<LINE>I could not but by her. The other motive,</LINE>
<LINE>Why to a public count I might not go,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the great love the general gender bear him;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</LINE>
<LINE>Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Would have reverted to my bow again,</LINE>
<LINE>And not where I had aim'd them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so have I a noble father lost;</LINE>
<LINE>A sister driven into desperate terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</LINE>
<LINE>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</LINE>
<LINE>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</LINE>
<LINE>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</LINE>
<LINE>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</LINE>
<LINE>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</LINE>
<LINE>I loved your father, and we love ourself;</LINE>
<LINE>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</LINE>
<LINE>This to your majesty; this to the queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Hamlet! who brought them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</LINE>
<LINE>They were given me by Claudio; he received them</LINE>
<LINE>Of him that brought them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on</LINE>
<LINE>your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see</LINE>
<LINE>your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your</LINE>
<LINE>pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden</LINE>
<LINE>and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'</LINE>
<LINE>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you the hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!</LINE>
<LINE>And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'</LINE>
<LINE>Can you advise me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</LINE>
<LINE>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>'Thus didest thou.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be so, Laertes--</LINE>
<LINE>As how should it be so? how otherwise?--</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be ruled by me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</LINE>
<LINE>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</LINE>
<LINE>No more to undertake it, I will work him</LINE>
<LINE>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</LINE>
<LINE>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</LINE>
<LINE>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</LINE>
<LINE>And call it accident.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I will be ruled;</LINE>
<LINE>The rather, if you could devise it so</LINE>
<LINE>That I might be the organ.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It falls right.</LINE>
<LINE>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</LINE>
<LINE>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</LINE>
<LINE>Did not together pluck such envy from him</LINE>
<LINE>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</LINE>
<LINE>Of the unworthiest siege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What part is that, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very riband in the cap of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</LINE>
<LINE>The light and careless livery that it wears</LINE>
<LINE>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</LINE>
<LINE>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--</LINE>
<LINE>I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</LINE>
<LINE>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</LINE>
<LINE>Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</LINE>
<LINE>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</LINE>
<LINE>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</LINE>
<LINE>With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</LINE>
<LINE>Come short of what he did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A Norman was't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A Norman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon my life, Lamond.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The very same.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</LINE>
<LINE>And gem of all the nation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He made confession of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And gave you such a masterly report</LINE>
<LINE>For art and exercise in your defence</LINE>
<LINE>And for your rapier most especially,</LINE>
<LINE>That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</LINE>
<LINE>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</LINE>
<LINE>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</LINE>
<LINE>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</LINE>
<LINE>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</LINE>
<LINE>Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, out of this,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What out of this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</LINE>
<LINE>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>A face without a heart?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why ask you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that I think you did not love your father;</LINE>
<LINE>But that I know love is begun by time;</LINE>
<LINE>And that I see, in passages of proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</LINE>
<LINE>There lives within the very flame of love</LINE>
<LINE>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</LINE>
<LINE>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</LINE>
<LINE>Dies in his own too much: that we would do</LINE>
<LINE>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</LINE>
<LINE>And hath abatements and delays as many</LINE>
<LINE>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</LINE>
<LINE>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</LINE>
<LINE>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</LINE>
<LINE>To show yourself your father's son in deed</LINE>
<LINE>More than in words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To cut his throat i' the church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</LINE>
<LINE>And set a double varnish on the fame</LINE>
<LINE>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</LINE>
<LINE>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</LINE>
<LINE>Most generous and free from all contriving,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</LINE>
<LINE>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</LINE>
<LINE>Requite him for your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do't:</LINE>
<LINE>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</LINE>
<LINE>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</LINE>
<LINE>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</LINE>
<LINE>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</LINE>
<LINE>Collected from all simples that have virtue</LINE>
<LINE>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</LINE>
<LINE>That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</LINE>
<LINE>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</LINE>
<LINE>It may be death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's further think of this;</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</LINE>
<LINE>May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</LINE>
<LINE>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</LINE>
<LINE>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</LINE>
<LINE>If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</LINE>
<LINE>When in your motion you are hot and dry--</LINE>
<LINE>As make your bouts more violent to that end--</LINE>
<LINE>And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</LINE>
<LINE>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</LINE>
<LINE>If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</LINE>
<LINE>Our purpose may hold there.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, sweet queen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One woe doth tread upon another's heel,</LINE>
<LINE>So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drown'd! O, where?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</LINE>
<LINE>That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;</LINE>
<LINE>There with fantastic garlands did she come</LINE>
<LINE>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</LINE>
<LINE>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</LINE>
<LINE>But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</LINE>
<LINE>There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</LINE>
<LINE>Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;</LINE>
<LINE>When down her weedy trophies and herself</LINE>
<LINE>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</LINE>
<LINE>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</LINE>
<LINE>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</LINE>
<LINE>As one incapable of her own distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a creature native and indued</LINE>
<LINE>Unto that element: but long it could not be</LINE>
<LINE>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</LINE>
<LINE>Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay</LINE>
<LINE>To muddy death.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, then, she is drown'd?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drown'd, drown'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet</LINE>
<LINE>It is our trick; nature her custom holds,</LINE>
<LINE>Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,</LINE>
<LINE>The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,</LINE>
<LINE>But that this folly douts it.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's follow, Gertrude:</LINE>
<LINE>How much I had to do to calm his rage!</LINE>
<LINE>Now fear I this will give it start again;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Clowns, with spades, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</LINE>
<LINE>wilfully seeks her own salvation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave</LINE>
<LINE>straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it</LINE>
<LINE>Christian burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her</LINE>
<LINE>own defence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis found so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For</LINE>
<LINE>here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,</LINE>
<LINE>it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it</LINE>
<LINE>is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned</LINE>
<LINE>herself wittingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here</LINE>
<LINE>stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,</LINE>
<LINE>and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he</LINE>
<LINE>goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him</LINE>
<LINE>and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he</LINE>
<LINE>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is this law?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been</LINE>
<LINE>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'</LINE>
<LINE>Christian burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that</LINE>
<LINE>great folk should have countenance in this world to</LINE>
<LINE>drown or hang themselves, more than their even</LINE>
<LINE>Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:</LINE>
<LINE>they hold up Adam's profession.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he a gentleman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was the first that ever bore arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he had none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the</LINE>
<LINE>Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'</LINE>
<LINE>could he dig without arms? I'll put another</LINE>
<LINE>question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the</LINE>
<LINE>purpose, confess thyself--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he that builds stronger than either the</LINE>
<LINE>mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a</LINE>
<LINE>thousand tenants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows</LINE>
<LINE>does well; but how does it well? it does well to</LINE>
<LINE>those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the</LINE>
<LINE>gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,</LINE>
<LINE>the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or</LINE>
<LINE>a carpenter?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, now I can tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mass, I cannot tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull</LINE>
<LINE>ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when</LINE>
<LINE>you are asked this question next, say 'a</LINE>
<LINE>grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till</LINE>
<LINE>doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a</LINE>
<LINE>stoup of liquor.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Second Clown</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>He digs and sings</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>In youth, when I did love, did love,</LINE>
<LINE>Methought it was very sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,</LINE>
<LINE>O, methought, there was nothing meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he</LINE>
<LINE>sings at grave-making?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath</LINE>
<LINE>the daintier sense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Sings</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>But age, with his stealing steps,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath claw'd me in his clutch,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath shipped me intil the land,</LINE>
<LINE>As if I had never been such.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Throws up a skull</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:</LINE>
<LINE>how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were</LINE>
<LINE>Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It</LINE>
<LINE>might be the pate of a politician, which this ass</LINE>
<LINE>now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,</LINE>
<LINE>might it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It might, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,</LINE>
<LINE>sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might</LINE>
<LINE>be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord</LINE>
<LINE>such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and</LINE>
<LINE>knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:</LINE>
<LINE>here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to</LINE>
<LINE>see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Sings</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,</LINE>
<LINE>For and a shrouding sheet:</LINE>
<LINE>O, a pit of clay for to be made</LINE>
<LINE>For such a guest is meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Throws up another skull</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's another: why may not that be the skull of a</LINE>
<LINE>lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,</LINE>
<LINE>his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he</LINE>
<LINE>suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the</LINE>
<LINE>sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of</LINE>
<LINE>his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be</LINE>
<LINE>in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,</LINE>
<LINE>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,</LINE>
<LINE>his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and</LINE>
<LINE>the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine</LINE>
<LINE>pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him</LINE>
<LINE>no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than</LINE>
<LINE>the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The</LINE>
<LINE>very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in</LINE>
<LINE>this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a jot more, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance</LINE>
<LINE>in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose</LINE>
<LINE>grave's this, sirrah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine, sir.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Sings</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, a pit of clay for to be made</LINE>
<LINE>For such a guest is meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not</LINE>
<LINE>yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:</LINE>
<LINE>'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What man dost thou dig it for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For no man, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What woman, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For none, neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is to be buried in't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the</LINE>
<LINE>card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of</LINE>
<LINE>it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the</LINE>
<LINE>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he</LINE>
<LINE>gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a</LINE>
<LINE>grave-maker?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day</LINE>
<LINE>that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long is that since?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it</LINE>
<LINE>was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that</LINE>
<LINE>is mad, and sent into England.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits</LINE>
<LINE>there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men</LINE>
<LINE>are as mad as he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How came he mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very strangely, they say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How strangely?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, e'en with losing his wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon what ground?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man</LINE>
<LINE>and boy, thirty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we</LINE>
<LINE>have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce</LINE>
<LINE>hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year</LINE>
<LINE>or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why he more than another?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that</LINE>
<LINE>he will keep out water a great while; and your water</LINE>
<LINE>is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.</LINE>
<LINE>Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth</LINE>
<LINE>three and twenty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose was it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a</LINE>
<LINE>flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me see.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Takes the skull</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow</LINE>
<LINE>of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath</LINE>
<LINE>borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how</LINE>
<LINE>abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at</LINE>
<LINE>it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know</LINE>
<LINE>not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your</LINE>
<LINE>gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,</LINE>
<LINE>that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one</LINE>
<LINE>now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?</LINE>
<LINE>Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let</LINE>
<LINE>her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must</LINE>
<LINE>come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell</LINE>
<LINE>me one thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'</LINE>
<LINE>the earth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And smelt so? pah!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Puts down the skull</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may</LINE>
<LINE>not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,</LINE>
<LINE>till he find it stopping a bung-hole?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with</LINE>
<LINE>modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as</LINE>
<LINE>thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,</LINE>
<LINE>Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of</LINE>
<LINE>earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he</LINE>
<LINE>was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?</LINE>
<LINE>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,</LINE>
<LINE>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:</LINE>
<LINE>O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!</LINE>
<LINE>But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Priest, &amp;c. in procession; the Corpse of
OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING
CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?</LINE>
<LINE>And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken</LINE>
<LINE>The corse they follow did with desperate hand</LINE>
<LINE>Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.</LINE>
<LINE>Couch we awhile, and mark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Retiring with HORATIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ceremony else?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>A very noble youth: mark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ceremony else?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Priest</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her obsequies have been as far enlarged</LINE>
<LINE>As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;</LINE>
<LINE>And, but that great command o'ersways the order,</LINE>
<LINE>She should in ground unsanctified have lodged</LINE>
<LINE>Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,</LINE>
<LINE>Her maiden strewments and the bringing home</LINE>
<LINE>Of bell and burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must there no more be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Priest</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more be done:</LINE>
<LINE>We should profane the service of the dead</LINE>
<LINE>To sing a requiem and such rest to her</LINE>
<LINE>As to peace-parted souls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lay her i' the earth:</LINE>
<LINE>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</LINE>
<LINE>May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,</LINE>
<LINE>A ministering angel shall my sister be,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou liest howling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, the fair Ophelia!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweets to the sweet: farewell!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Scattering flowers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;</LINE>
<LINE>I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,</LINE>
<LINE>And not have strew'd thy grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, treble woe</LINE>
<LINE>Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense</LINE>
<LINE>Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Leaps into the grave</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Till of this flat a mountain you have made,</LINE>
<LINE>To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head</LINE>
<LINE>Of blue Olympus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Advancing</STAGEDIR>     What is he whose grief</LINE>
<LINE>Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand</LINE>

<LINE>Hamlet the Dane.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Leaps into the grave</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Thou pray'st not well.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;</LINE>
<LINE>For, though I am not splenitive and rash,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:</LINE>
<LINE>Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?</LINE>
<LINE>To outface me with leaping in her grave?</LINE>
<LINE>Be buried quick with her, and so will I:</LINE>
<LINE>And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw</LINE>
<LINE>Millions of acres on us, till our ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Singeing his pate against the burning zone,</LINE>
<LINE>Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll rant as well as thou.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is mere madness:</LINE>
<LINE>And thus awhile the fit will work on him;</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, as patient as the female dove,</LINE>
<LINE>When that her golden couplets are disclosed,</LINE>
<LINE>His silence will sit drooping.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear you, sir;</LINE>
<LINE>What is the reason that you use me thus?</LINE>
<LINE>I loved you ever: but it is no matter;</LINE>
<LINE>Let Hercules himself do what he may,</LINE>
<LINE>The cat will mew and dog will have his day.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit HORATIO</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>To LAERTES</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll put the matter to the present push.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.</LINE>
<LINE>This grave shall have a living monument:</LINE>

<LINE>Till then, in patience our proceeding be.</LINE>

</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A hall in the castle.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;</LINE>
<LINE>You do remember all the circumstance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember it, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,</LINE>
<LINE>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</LINE>
<LINE>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,</LINE>
<LINE>And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</LINE>
<LINE>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</LINE>
<LINE>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us</LINE>
<LINE>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</LINE>
<LINE>Rough-hew them how we will,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is most certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Up from my cabin,</LINE>
<LINE>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</LINE>
<LINE>Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</LINE>
<LINE>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own room again; making so bold,</LINE>
<LINE>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</LINE>
<LINE>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--</LINE>
<LINE>O royal knavery!--an exact command,</LINE>
<LINE>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</LINE>
<LINE>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,</LINE>
<LINE>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</LINE>
<LINE>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</LINE>
<LINE>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</LINE>
<LINE>My head should be struck off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.</LINE>
<LINE>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</LINE>
<LINE>They had begun the play--I sat me down,</LINE>
<LINE>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</LINE>
<LINE>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</LINE>
<LINE>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</LINE>
<LINE>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</LINE>
<LINE>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</LINE>
<LINE>The effect of what I wrote?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, good my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An earnest conjuration from the king,</LINE>
<LINE>As England was his faithful tributary,</LINE>
<LINE>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</LINE>
<LINE>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</LINE>
<LINE>And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</LINE>
<LINE>And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,</LINE>
<LINE>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</LINE>
<LINE>Without debatement further, more or less,</LINE>
<LINE>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</LINE>
<LINE>Not shriving-time allow'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How was this seal'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</LINE>
<LINE>I had my father's signet in my purse,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</LINE>
<LINE>Folded the writ up in form of the other,</LINE>
<LINE>Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,</LINE>
<LINE>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</LINE>
<LINE>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</LINE>
<LINE>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</LINE>
<LINE>Does by their own insinuation grow:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</LINE>
<LINE>Between the pass and fell incensed points</LINE>
<LINE>Of mighty opposites.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a king is this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--</LINE>
<LINE>He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</LINE>
<LINE>And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To let this canker of our nature come</LINE>
<LINE>In further evil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be shortly known to him from England</LINE>
<LINE>What is the issue of the business there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will be short: the interim is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'</LINE>
<LINE>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</LINE>
<LINE>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by the image of my cause, I see</LINE>
<LINE>The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.</LINE>
<LINE>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</LINE>
<LINE>Into a towering passion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace! who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter OSRIC</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to</LINE>
<LINE>know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a</LINE>
<LINE>beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at</LINE>
<LINE>the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,</LINE>
<LINE>spacious in the possession of dirt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I</LINE>
<LINE>should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of</LINE>
<LINE>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is</LINE>
<LINE>northerly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my</LINE>
<LINE>complexion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as</LINE>
<LINE>'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his</LINE>
<LINE>majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a</LINE>
<LINE>great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, remember--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>HAMLET moves him to put on his hat</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</LINE>
<LINE>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</LINE>
<LINE>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</LINE>
<LINE>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</LINE>
<LINE>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</LINE>
<LINE>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</LINE>
<LINE>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</LINE>
<LINE>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</LINE>
<LINE>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</LINE>
<LINE>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</LINE>
<LINE>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</LINE>
<LINE>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</LINE>
<LINE>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</LINE>
<LINE>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>in our more rawer breath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?</LINE>
<LINE>You will do't, sir, really.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Laertes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of him, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you are not ignorant--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,</LINE>
<LINE>it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with</LINE>
<LINE>him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to</LINE>
<LINE>know himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation</LINE>
<LINE>laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's his weapon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rapier and dagger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's two of his weapons: but, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</LINE>
<LINE>horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take</LINE>
<LINE>it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</LINE>
<LINE>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</LINE>
<LINE>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</LINE>
<LINE>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,</LINE>
<LINE>and of very liberal conceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What call you the carriages?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we</LINE>
<LINE>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might</LINE>
<LINE>be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses</LINE>
<LINE>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</LINE>
<LINE>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet</LINE>
<LINE>against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes</LINE>
<LINE>between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you</LINE>
<LINE>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it</LINE>
<LINE>would come to immediate trial, if your lordship</LINE>
<LINE>would vouchsafe the answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if I answer 'no'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his</LINE>
<LINE>majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let</LINE>
<LINE>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</LINE>
<LINE>king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;</LINE>
<LINE>if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I commend my duty to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yours, yours.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit OSRIC</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He does well to commend it himself; there are no</LINE>
<LINE>tongues else for's turn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I</LINE>
<LINE>know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of</LINE>
<LINE>the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of</LINE>
<LINE>yesty collection, which carries them through and</LINE>
<LINE>through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do</LINE>
<LINE>but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Lord</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young</LINE>
<LINE>Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in</LINE>
<LINE>the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to</LINE>
<LINE>play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's</LINE>
<LINE>pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now</LINE>
<LINE>or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king and queen and all are coming down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In happy time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The queen desires you to use some gentle</LINE>
<LINE>entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She well instructs me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lord</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will lose this wager, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not think so: since he went into France, I</LINE>
<LINE>have been in continual practise: I shall win at the</LINE>
<LINE>odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here</LINE>
<LINE>about my heart: but it is no matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of</LINE>
<LINE>gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will</LINE>
<LINE>forestall their repair hither, and say you are not</LINE>
<LINE>fit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special</LINE>
<LINE>providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,</LINE>
<LINE>'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be</LINE>
<LINE>now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the</LINE>
<LINE>readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he</LINE>
<LINE>leaves, what is't to leave betimes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,
Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>This presence knows,</LINE>
<LINE>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd</LINE>
<LINE>With sore distraction. What I have done,</LINE>
<LINE>That might your nature, honour and exception</LINE>
<LINE>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</LINE>
<LINE>Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:</LINE>
<LINE>If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;</LINE>
<LINE>His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, in this audience,</LINE>
<LINE>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil</LINE>
<LINE>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,</LINE>
<LINE>And hurt my brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am satisfied in nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most</LINE>
<LINE>To my revenge: but in my terms of honour</LINE>
<LINE>I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,</LINE>
<LINE>Till by some elder masters, of known honour,</LINE>
<LINE>I have a voice and precedent of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep my name ungored. But till that time,</LINE>
<LINE>I do receive your offer'd love like love,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not wrong it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I embrace it freely;</LINE>
<LINE>And will this brother's wager frankly play.</LINE>
<LINE>Give us the foils. Come on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, one for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance</LINE>
<LINE>Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,</LINE>
<LINE>Stick fiery off indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mock me, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by this hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>You know the wager?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well, my lord</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not fear it; I have seen you both:</LINE>
<LINE>But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is too heavy, let me see another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They prepare to play</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.</LINE>
<LINE>If Hamlet give the first or second hit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,</LINE>
<LINE>Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:</LINE>
<LINE>The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</LINE>
<LINE>Richer than that which four successive kings</LINE>
<LINE>In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;</LINE>
<LINE>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</LINE>
<LINE>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</LINE>
<LINE>The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,</LINE>
<LINE>'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:</LINE>
<LINE>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They play</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A hit, a very palpable hit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;</LINE>
<LINE>Here's to thy health.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Give him the cup.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They play</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Another hit; what say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A touch, a touch, I do confess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our son shall win.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's fat, and scant of breath.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;</LINE>
<LINE>The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</LINE>

<LINE>I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Come, let me wipe thy face.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I'll hit him now.</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, pass with your best violence;</LINE>
<LINE>I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they
change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Part them; they are incensed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Look to the queen there, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is't, Laertes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;</LINE>
<LINE>I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How does the queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She swounds to see them bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN GERTRUDE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--</LINE>
<LINE>The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Treachery! Seek it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;</LINE>
<LINE>No medicine in the world can do thee good;</LINE>
<LINE>In thee there is not half an hour of life;</LINE>
<LINE>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise</LINE>
<LINE>Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:</LINE>
<LINE>I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The point!--envenom'd too!</LINE>
<LINE>Then, venom, to thy work.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,</LINE>
<LINE>Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?</LINE>
<LINE>Follow my mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>KING CLAUDIUS dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAERTES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is justly served;</LINE>
<LINE>It is a poison temper'd by himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:</LINE>
<LINE>Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor thine on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.</LINE>
<LINE>I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!</LINE>
<LINE>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,</LINE>
<LINE>That are but mutes or audience to this act,</LINE>
<LINE>Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,</LINE>
<LINE>Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--</LINE>
<LINE>But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou livest; report me and my cause aright</LINE>
<LINE>To the unsatisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never believe it:</LINE>
<LINE>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:</LINE>
<LINE>Here's yet some liquor left.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou'rt a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.</LINE>
<LINE>O good Horatio, what a wounded name,</LINE>
<LINE>Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart</LINE>
<LINE>Absent thee from felicity awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell my story.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>March afar off, and shot within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What warlike noise is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSRIC</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,</LINE>
<LINE>To the ambassadors of England gives</LINE>
<LINE>This warlike volley.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAMLET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I die, Horatio;</LINE>
<LINE>The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot live to hear the news from England;</LINE>
<LINE>But I do prophesy the election lights</LINE>
<LINE>On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;</LINE>
<LINE>So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,</LINE>
<LINE>Which have solicited. The rest is silence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:</LINE>
<LINE>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!</LINE>
<LINE>Why does the drum come hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>March within</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is this sight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it ye would see?</LINE>
<LINE>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</LINE>
<LINE>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou so many princes at a shot</LINE>
<LINE>So bloodily hast struck?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Ambassador</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sight is dismal;</LINE>
<LINE>And our affairs from England come too late:</LINE>
<LINE>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Where should we have our thanks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not from his mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</LINE>
<LINE>He never gave commandment for their death.</LINE>
<LINE>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</LINE>
<LINE>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</LINE>
<LINE>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</LINE>
<LINE>High on a stage be placed to the view;</LINE>
<LINE>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</LINE>
<LINE>How these things came about: so shall you hear</LINE>
<LINE>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</LINE>
<LINE>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</LINE>
<LINE>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</LINE>
<LINE>Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I</LINE>
<LINE>Truly deliver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us haste to hear it,</LINE>
<LINE>And call the noblest to the audience.</LINE>
<LINE>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</LINE>
<LINE>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;</LINE>
<LINE>But let this same be presently perform'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance</LINE>
<LINE>On plots and errors, happen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let four captains</LINE>
<LINE>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</LINE>
<LINE>For he was likely, had he been put on,</LINE>
<LINE>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldiers' music and the rites of war</LINE>
<LINE>Speak loudly for him.</LINE>
<LINE>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</LINE>
<LINE>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</LINE>
<LINE>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</LINE>
<LINE>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</LINE>
<LINE>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</LINE>
<LINE>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>He cried upon it at the merest loss</LINE>
<LINE>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</LINE>
<LINE>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</LINE>
<LINE>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</LINE>
<LINE>But sup them well and look unto them all:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>

<LINE>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Second Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</LINE>
<LINE>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</LINE>
<LINE>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</LINE>
<LINE>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</LINE>
<LINE>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</LINE>
<LINE>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</LINE>
<LINE>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</LINE>
<LINE>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</LINE>
<LINE>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</LINE>
<LINE>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</LINE>
<LINE>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</LINE>
<LINE>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</LINE>
<LINE>And with a low submissive reverence</LINE>
<LINE>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</LINE>
<LINE>Let one attend him with a silver basin</LINE>
<LINE>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</LINE>
<LINE>Some one be ready with a costly suit</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</LINE>
<LINE>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</LINE>
<LINE>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</LINE>
<LINE>It will be pastime passing excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>If it be husbanded with modesty.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</LINE>
<LINE>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</LINE>
<LINE>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</LINE>
<LINE>The rather for I have some sport in hand</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</LINE>
<LINE>For yet his honour never heard a play--</LINE>
<LINE>You break into some merry passion</LINE>
<LINE>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</LINE>
<LINE>If you should smile he grows impatient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</LINE>
<LINE>And give them friendly welcome every one:</LINE>
<LINE>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit one with the Players</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</LINE>
<LINE>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</LINE>
<LINE>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</LINE>
<LINE>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</LINE>
<LINE>He bear himself with honourable action,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</LINE>
<LINE>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</LINE>
<LINE>May show her duty and make known her love?'</LINE>
<LINE>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</LINE>
<LINE>And with declining head into his bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</LINE>
<LINE>To see her noble lord restored to health,</LINE>
<LINE>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</LINE>
<LINE>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</LINE>
<LINE>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</LINE>
<LINE>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</LINE>
<LINE>An onion will do well for such a shift,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</LINE>
<LINE>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</LINE>
<LINE>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit a Servingman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</LINE>
<LINE>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</LINE>
<LINE>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</LINE>
<LINE>May well abate the over-merry spleen</LINE>

<LINE>I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor</LINE>
<LINE>'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if</LINE>
<LINE>you give me any conserves, give me conserves of</LINE>
<LINE>beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I</LINE>
<LINE>have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings</LINE>
<LINE>than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,</LINE>
<LINE>sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my</LINE>
<LINE>toes look through the over-leather.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a</LINE>

<LINE>bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?</LINE>
<LINE>Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if</LINE>
<LINE>she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence</LINE>

<LINE>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment</LINE>
<LINE>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.</LINE>
<LINE>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,</LINE>

<LINE>Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed</LINE>

<LINE>But did I never speak of all that time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:</LINE>
<LINE>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;</LINE>
<LINE>And rail upon the hostess of the house;</LINE>
<LINE>And say you would present her at the leet,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</LINE>

<LINE>For your physicians have expressly charged,</LINE>
<LINE>In peril to incur your former malady,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should yet absent me from your bed:</LINE>
<LINE>I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, it stands so that I may hardly</LINE>
<LINE>tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</LINE>
<LINE>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</LINE>
<LINE>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasant garden of great Italy;</LINE>
<LINE>And by my father's love and leave am arm'd</LINE>
<LINE>With his good will and thy good company,</LINE>
<LINE>My trusty servant, well approved in all,</LINE>
<LINE>Here let us breathe and haply institute</LINE>
<LINE>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</LINE>
<LINE>Pisa renown'd for grave citizens</LINE>
<LINE>Gave me my being and my father first,</LINE>
<LINE>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Vincetino come of Bentivolii.</LINE>
<LINE>Vincetino's son brought up in Florence</LINE>
<LINE>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,</LINE>
<LINE>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue and that part of philosophy</LINE>
<LINE>Will I apply that treats of happiness</LINE>
<LINE>By virtue specially to be achieved.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left</LINE>
<LINE>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</LINE>
<LINE>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</LINE>
<LINE>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,</LINE>
<LINE>I am in all affected as yourself;</LINE>
<LINE>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</LINE>
<LINE>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</LINE>
<LINE>Only, good master, while we do admire</LINE>
<LINE>This virtue and this moral discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;</LINE>
<LINE>Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques</LINE>
<LINE>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:</LINE>
<LINE>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have</LINE>
<LINE>And practise rhetoric in your common talk;</LINE>
<LINE>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</LINE>
<LINE>The mathematics and the metaphysics,</LINE>
<LINE>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;</LINE>
<LINE>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</LINE>
<LINE>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</LINE>

<LINE>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</LINE>
<LINE>For how I firmly am resolved you know;</LINE>
<LINE>That is, not bestow my youngest daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Before I have a husband for the elder:</LINE>
<LINE>If either of you both love Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I know you well and love you well,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, is it your will</LINE>
<LINE>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:</LINE>
<LINE>I wis it is not half way to her heart;</LINE>
<LINE>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</LINE>
<LINE>To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool</LINE>
<LINE>And paint your face and use you like a fool.</LINE>

<LINE>Sorry am I that our good will effects</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why will you mew her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:</LINE>
<LINE>Go in, Bianca:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BIANCA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And for I know she taketh most delight</LINE>
<LINE>In music, instruments and poetry,</LINE>
<LINE>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,</LINE>
<LINE>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</LINE>
<LINE>Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</LINE>
<LINE>Prefer them hither; for to cunning men</LINE>
<LINE>I will be very kind, and liberal</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own children in good bringing up:</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have more to commune with Bianca.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,</LINE>

<LINE>knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so</LINE>
<LINE>good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not</LINE>
<LINE>so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails</LINE>
<LINE>together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on</LINE>
<LINE>both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my</LINE>
<LINE>sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit</LINE>
<LINE>man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will</LINE>
<LINE>wish him to her father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.</LINE>
<LINE>Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked</LINE>
<LINE>parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,</LINE>
<LINE>that we may yet again have access to our fair</LINE>
<LINE>mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to</LINE>
<LINE>labour and effect one thing specially.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A husband! a devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though</LINE>
<LINE>her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool</LINE>
<LINE>to be married to hell?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine</LINE>
<LINE>to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good</LINE>
<LINE>fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,</LINE>
<LINE>would take her with all faults, and money enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with</LINE>
<LINE>this condition, to be whipped at the high cross</LINE>
<LINE>every morning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten</LINE>
<LINE>apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us</LINE>
<LINE>friends, it shall be so far forth friendly</LINE>
<LINE>maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter</LINE>
<LINE>to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,</LINE>
<LINE>and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man</LINE>
<LINE>be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, Signior Gremio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am agreed; and would I had given him the best</LINE>
<LINE>horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</LINE>
<LINE>thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the</LINE>
<LINE>house of her! Come on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</LINE>
<LINE>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</LINE>
<LINE>I never thought it possible or likely;</LINE>
<LINE>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</LINE>
<LINE>I found the effect of love in idleness:</LINE>
<LINE>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That art to me as secret and as dear</LINE>
<LINE>As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,</LINE>
<LINE>Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</LINE>
<LINE>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</LINE>
<LINE>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, it is no time to chide you now;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection is not rated from the heart:</LINE>
<LINE>If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,</LINE>
<LINE>'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:</LINE>
<LINE>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</LINE>
<LINE>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.</LINE>
<LINE>When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister</LINE>
<LINE>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</LINE>
<LINE>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move</LINE>
<LINE>And with her breath she did perfume the air:</LINE>
<LINE>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</LINE>
<LINE>Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>That till the father rid his hands of her,</LINE>
<LINE>Master, your love must live a maid at home;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!</LINE>
<LINE>But art thou not advised, he took some care</LINE>
<LINE>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have it, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, for my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me thine first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will be schoolmaster</LINE>
<LINE>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</LINE>
<LINE>That's your device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is: may it be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</LINE>
<LINE>And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Basta; content thee, for I have it full.</LINE>
<LINE>We have not yet been seen in any house,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces</LINE>
<LINE>For man or master; then it follows thus;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and port and servants as I should:</LINE>
<LINE>I will some other be, some Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once</LINE>
<LINE>Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:</LINE>
<LINE>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So had you need.</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am tied to be obedient;</LINE>
<LINE>For so your father charged me at our parting,</LINE>
<LINE>'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>Although I think 'twas in another sense;</LINE>
<LINE>I am content to be Lucentio,</LINE>
<LINE>Because so well I love Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:</LINE>
<LINE>And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the rogue.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, where have you been?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?</LINE>
<LINE>Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or</LINE>
<LINE>you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frame your manners to the time.</LINE>
<LINE>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts my apparel and my countenance on,</LINE>
<LINE>And I for my escape have put on his;</LINE>
<LINE>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</LINE>
<LINE>I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:</LINE>
<LINE>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</LINE>
<LINE>While I make way from hence to save my life:</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, sir! ne'er a whit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:</LINE>
<LINE>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The better for him: would I were so too!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise</LINE>
<LINE>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:</LINE>
<LINE>When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;</LINE>
<LINE>But in all places else your master Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that</LINE>
<LINE>thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if</LINE>
<LINE>thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good</LINE>
<LINE>and weighty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>The presenters above speak</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:</LINE>
<LINE>comes there any more of it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, 'tis but begun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:</LINE>
<LINE>would 'twere done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They sit and mark</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verona, for a while I take my leave,</LINE>
<LINE>To see my friends in Padua, but of all</LINE>
<LINE>My best beloved and approved friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has</LINE>
<LINE>rebused your worship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that</LINE>
<LINE>I should knock you here, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate</LINE>
<LINE>And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock</LINE>
<LINE>you first,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I know after who comes by the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it not be?</LINE>
<LINE>Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He wrings him by the ears</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help, masters, help! my master is mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!</LINE>
<LINE>and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</LINE>
<LINE>'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor</LINE>
<LINE>mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound</LINE>
<LINE>this quarrel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.</LINE>
<LINE>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his</LINE>
<LINE>service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap</LINE>
<LINE>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to</LINE>
<LINE>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,</LINE>
<LINE>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had</LINE>
<LINE>well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</LINE>
<LINE>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</LINE>
<LINE>And could not get him for my heart to do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these</LINE>
<LINE>words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,</LINE>
<LINE>knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you</LINE>
<LINE>now with, 'knocking at the gate'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</LINE>
<LINE>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</LINE>
<LINE>To seek their fortunes farther than at home</LINE>
<LINE>Where small experience grows. But in a few,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</LINE>
<LINE>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</LINE>
<LINE>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</LINE>
<LINE>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</LINE>
<LINE>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</LINE>
<LINE>And so am come abroad to see the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</LINE>
<LINE>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich</LINE>
<LINE>And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll not wish thee to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we</LINE>
<LINE>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</LINE>
<LINE>One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</LINE>
<LINE>Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,</LINE>
<LINE>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,</LINE>
<LINE>She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</LINE>
<LINE>Affection's edge in me, were she as rough</LINE>
<LINE>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:</LINE>
<LINE>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</LINE>
<LINE>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his</LINE>
<LINE>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to</LINE>
<LINE>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er</LINE>
<LINE>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases</LINE>
<LINE>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,</LINE>
<LINE>so money comes withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,</LINE>
<LINE>I will continue that I broach'd in jest.</LINE>
<LINE>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</LINE>
<LINE>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:</LINE>
<LINE>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Is that she is intolerable curst</LINE>
<LINE>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</LINE>
<LINE>That, were my state far worser than it is,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her father is Baptista Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>An affable and courteous gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>Her name is Katharina Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know her father, though I know not her;</LINE>
<LINE>And he knew my deceased father well.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</LINE>
<LINE>To give you over at this first encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you will accompany me thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.</LINE>
<LINE>O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she</LINE>
<LINE>would think scolding would do little good upon him:</LINE>
<LINE>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:</LINE>
<LINE>why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in</LINE>
<LINE>his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she</LINE>
<LINE>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in</LINE>
<LINE>her face and so disfigure her with it that she</LINE>
<LINE>shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.</LINE>
<LINE>You know him not, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</LINE>
<LINE>For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</LINE>
<LINE>His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,</LINE>
<LINE>And her withholds from me and other more,</LINE>
<LINE>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</LINE>
<LINE>Supposing it a thing impossible,</LINE>
<LINE>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever Katharina will be woo'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,</LINE>
<LINE>That none shall have access unto Bianca</LINE>
<LINE>Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katharina the curst!</LINE>
<LINE>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</LINE>
<LINE>And offer me disguised in sober robes</LINE>
<LINE>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</LINE>
<LINE>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;</LINE>
<LINE>That so I may, by this device, at least</LINE>
<LINE>Have leave and leisure to make love to her</LINE>
<LINE>And unsuspected court her by herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,</LINE>
<LINE>how the young folks lay their heads together!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.</LINE>
<LINE>Petruchio, stand by a while.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper stripling and an amorous!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, very well; I have perused the note.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:</LINE>
<LINE>All books of love, see that at any hand;</LINE>
<LINE>And see you read no other lectures to her:</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me: over and beside</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista's liberality,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me have them very well perfumed</LINE>
<LINE>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</LINE>
<LINE>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you</LINE>
<LINE>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</LINE>
<LINE>As firmly as yourself were still in place:</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</LINE>
<LINE>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O this learning, what a thing it is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, sirrah!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.</LINE>
<LINE>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</LINE>
<LINE>I promised to inquire carefully</LINE>
<LINE>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:</LINE>
<LINE>And by good fortune I have lighted well</LINE>
<LINE>On this young man, for learning and behavior</LINE>
<LINE>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry</LINE>
<LINE>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Hath promised me to help me to another,</LINE>
<LINE>A fine musician to instruct our mistress;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</LINE>
<LINE>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that his bags shall prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:</LINE>
<LINE>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon agreement from us to his liking,</LINE>
<LINE>Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So said, so done, is well.</LINE>
<LINE>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know she is an irksome brawling scold:</LINE>
<LINE>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:</LINE>
<LINE>My father dead, my fortune lives for me;</LINE>
<LINE>And I do hope good days and long to see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!</LINE>
<LINE>But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have me assisting you in all.</LINE>
<LINE>But will you woo this wild-cat?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will I live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why came I hither but to that intent?</LINE>
<LINE>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds</LINE>
<LINE>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,</LINE>
<LINE>And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</LINE>
<LINE>Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?</LINE>
<LINE>And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</LINE>
<LINE>As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?</LINE>
<LINE>Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For he fears none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, hark:</LINE>
<LINE>This gentleman is happily arrived,</LINE>
<LINE>My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I promised we would be contributors</LINE>
<LINE>And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so we will, provided that he win her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way</LINE>
<LINE>To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he, Biondello.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well begun, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, a word ere you go;</LINE>
<LINE>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; if without more words you will get you hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free</LINE>
<LINE>For me as for you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But so is not she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For what reason, I beseech you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this reason, if you'll know,</LINE>
<LINE>That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Do me this right; hear me with patience.</LINE>
<LINE>Baptista is a noble gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom my father is not all unknown;</LINE>
<LINE>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</LINE>
<LINE>She may more suitors have and me for one.</LINE>
<LINE>Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;</LINE>
<LINE>Then well one more may fair Bianca have:</LINE>
<LINE>And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</LINE>
<LINE>Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,</LINE>
<LINE>The one as famous for a scolding tongue</LINE>
<LINE>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;</LINE>
<LINE>And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:</LINE>
<LINE>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for</LINE>
<LINE>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not promise her to any man</LINE>
<LINE>Until the elder sister first be wed:</LINE>
<LINE>The younger then is free and not before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</LINE>
<LINE>Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</LINE>
<LINE>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</LINE>
<LINE>For our access, whose hap shall be to have her</LINE>
<LINE>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;</LINE>
<LINE>And since you do profess to be a suitor,</LINE>
<LINE>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom we all rest generally beholding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,</LINE>
<LINE>Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,</LINE>
<LINE>And do as adversaries do in law,</LINE>
<LINE>Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>The motion's good indeed and be it so,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;</LINE>
<LINE>That I disdain: but for these other gawds,</LINE>
<LINE>Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;</LINE>
<LINE>Or what you will command me will I do,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, sister, of all the men alive</LINE>
<LINE>I never yet beheld that special face</LINE>
<LINE>Which I could fancy more than any other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you affect him, sister, here I swear</LINE>
<LINE>I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have</LINE>
<LINE>him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O then, belike, you fancy riches more:</LINE>
<LINE>You will have Gremio to keep you fair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it for him you do envy me so?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive</LINE>
<LINE>You have but jested with me all this while:</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BAPTISTA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?</LINE>
<LINE>Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.</LINE>
<LINE>Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.</LINE>
<LINE>For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?</LINE>
<LINE>When did she cross thee with a bitter word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see</LINE>
<LINE>She is your treasure, she must have a husband;</LINE>
<LINE>I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day</LINE>
<LINE>And for your love to her lead apes in hell.</LINE>
<LINE>Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.</LINE>
<LINE>God save you, gentlemen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too blunt: go to it orderly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.</LINE>
<LINE>I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,</LINE>
<LINE>Her affability and bashful modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,</LINE>
<LINE>Am bold to show myself a forward guest</LINE>
<LINE>Within your house, to make mine eye the witness</LINE>
<LINE>Of that report which I so oft have heard.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for an entrance to my entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>I do present you with a man of mine,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cunning in music and the mathematics,</LINE>
<LINE>To instruct her fully in those sciences,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof I know she is not ignorant:</LINE>
<LINE>Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:</LINE>
<LINE>His name is Licio, born in Mantua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.</LINE>
<LINE>But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,</LINE>
<LINE>She is not for your turn, the more my grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see you do not mean to part with her,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else you like not of my company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.</LINE>
<LINE>Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,</LINE>
<LINE>A man well known throughout all Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:</LINE>
<LINE>Baccare! you are marvellous forward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your</LINE>
<LINE>wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am</LINE>
<LINE>sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</LINE>
<LINE>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</LINE>
<LINE>any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting LUCENTIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning</LINE>
<LINE>in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other</LINE>
<LINE>in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,</LINE>
<LINE>accept his service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome, good Cambio.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To TRANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:</LINE>
<LINE>may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being a stranger in this city here,</LINE>
<LINE>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</LINE>
<LINE>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</LINE>
<LINE>This liberty is all that I request,</LINE>
<LINE>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo</LINE>
<LINE>And free access and favour as the rest:</LINE>
<LINE>And, toward the education of your daughters,</LINE>
<LINE>I here bestow a simple instrument,</LINE>
<LINE>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:</LINE>
<LINE>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A mighty man of Pisa; by report</LINE>
<LINE>I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Take you the lute, and you the set of books;</LINE>
<LINE>You shall go see your pupils presently.</LINE>
<LINE>Holla, within!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>To my daughters; and tell them both,</LINE>
<LINE>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,
BIONDELLO following</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day I cannot come to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>You knew my father well, and in him me,</LINE>
<LINE>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have better'd rather than decreased:</LINE>
<LINE>Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,</LINE>
<LINE>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After my death the one half of my lands,</LINE>
<LINE>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of</LINE>
<LINE>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</LINE>
<LINE>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</LINE>
<LINE>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</LINE>
<LINE>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,</LINE>
<LINE>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</LINE>
<LINE>And where two raging fires meet together</LINE>
<LINE>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:</LINE>
<LINE>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</LINE>
<LINE>So I to her and so she yields to me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</LINE>
<LINE>But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,</LINE>
<LINE>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think she'll sooner prove a soldier</LINE>
<LINE>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.</LINE>
<LINE>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</LINE>
<LINE>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;</LINE>
<LINE>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume</LINE>
<LINE>with them:'</LINE>
<LINE>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,</LINE>
<LINE>And through the instrument my pate made way;</LINE>
<LINE>And there I stood amazed for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;</LINE>
<LINE>While she did call me rascal fiddler</LINE>
<LINE>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,</LINE>
<LINE>As had she studied to misuse me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;</LINE>
<LINE>I love her ten times more than e'er I did:</LINE>
<LINE>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:</LINE>
<LINE>Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you do.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will attend her here,</LINE>
<LINE>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain</LINE>
<LINE>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear</LINE>
<LINE>As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:</LINE>
<LINE>Say she be mute and will not speak a word;</LINE>
<LINE>Then I'll commend her volubility,</LINE>
<LINE>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</LINE>
<LINE>If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</LINE>
<LINE>If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall ask the banns and when be married.</LINE>
<LINE>But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:</LINE>
<LINE>They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;</LINE>
<LINE>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom</LINE>
<LINE>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither</LINE>
<LINE>Remove you hence: I knew you at the first</LINE>
<LINE>You were a moveable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what's a moveable?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A join'd-stool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Women are made to bear, and so are you.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No such jade as you, if me you mean.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For, knowing thee to be but young and light--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too light for such a swain as you to catch;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should be! should--buzz!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who knows not where a wasp does</LINE>
<LINE>wear his sting? In his tail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose tongue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,</LINE>
<LINE>Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I'll try.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>She strikes him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So may you lose your arms:</LINE>
<LINE>If you strike me, you are no gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is your crest? a coxcomb?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my fashion, when I see a crab.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is, there is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then show it me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I a glass, I would.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, you mean my face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well aim'd of such a young one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet you are wither'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis with cares.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I care not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,</LINE>
<LINE>And now I find report a very liar;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,</LINE>
<LINE>But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle conference, soft and affable.</LINE>
<LINE>Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?</LINE>
<LINE>O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig</LINE>
<LINE>Is straight and slender and as brown in hue</LINE>
<LINE>As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did ever Dian so become a grove</LINE>
<LINE>As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?</LINE>
<LINE>O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;</LINE>
<LINE>And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where did you study all this goodly speech?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is extempore, from my mother-wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A witty mother! witless else her son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not wise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; keep you warm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, setting all this chat aside,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented</LINE>
<LINE>That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou must be married to no man but me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am he am born to tame you Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate</LINE>
<LINE>Conformable as other household Kates.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes your father: never make denial;</LINE>
<LINE>I must and will have Katharina to my wife.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How but well, sir? how but well?</LINE>
<LINE>It were impossible I should speed amiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call you me daughter? now, I promise you</LINE>
<LINE>You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,</LINE>
<LINE>To wish me wed to one half lunatic;</LINE>
<LINE>A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,</LINE>
<LINE>That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:</LINE>
<LINE>If she be curst, it is for policy,</LINE>
<LINE>For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;</LINE>
<LINE>She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;</LINE>
<LINE>For patience she will prove a second Grissel,</LINE>
<LINE>And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:</LINE>
<LINE>And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,</LINE>
<LINE>That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee</LINE>
<LINE>hang'd first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:</LINE>
<LINE>If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,</LINE>
<LINE>That she shall still be curst in company.</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe</LINE>
<LINE>How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!</LINE>
<LINE>She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss</LINE>
<LINE>She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,</LINE>
<LINE>That in a twink she won me to her love.</LINE>
<LINE>O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,</LINE>
<LINE>How tame, when men and women are alone,</LINE>
<LINE>A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,</LINE>
<LINE>To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.</LINE>
<LINE>Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;</LINE>
<LINE>I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not what to say: but give me your hands;</LINE>
<LINE>God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;</LINE>
<LINE>I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:</LINE>
<LINE>We will have rings and things and fine array;</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,</LINE>
<LINE>And venture madly on a desperate mart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.</LINE>
<LINE>But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the day we long have looked for:</LINE>
<LINE>I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am one that love Bianca more</LINE>
<LINE>Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thine doth fry.</LINE>
<LINE>Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both</LINE>
<LINE>That can assure my daughter greatest dower</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have my Bianca's love.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, as you know, my house within the city</LINE>
<LINE>Is richly furnished with plate and gold;</LINE>
<LINE>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;</LINE>
<LINE>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;</LINE>
<LINE>In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;</LINE>
<LINE>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,</LINE>
<LINE>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</LINE>
<LINE>Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</LINE>
<LINE>Pewter and brass and all things that belong</LINE>
<LINE>To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm</LINE>
<LINE>I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,</LINE>
<LINE>Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,</LINE>
<LINE>And all things answerable to this portion.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself am struck in years, I must confess;</LINE>
<LINE>And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,</LINE>
<LINE>If whilst I live she will be only mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am my father's heir and only son:</LINE>
<LINE>If I may have your daughter to my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll leave her houses three or four as good,</LINE>
<LINE>Within rich Pisa walls, as any one</LINE>
<LINE>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides two thousand ducats by the year</LINE>
<LINE>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.</LINE>
<LINE>What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two thousand ducats by the year of land!</LINE>
<LINE>My land amounts not to so much in all:</LINE>
<LINE>That she shall have; besides an argosy</LINE>
<LINE>That now is lying in Marseilles' road.</LINE>
<LINE>What, have I choked you with an argosy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,</LINE>
<LINE>And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,</LINE>
<LINE>And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;</LINE>
<LINE>And she can have no more than all I have:</LINE>
<LINE>If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must confess your offer is the best;</LINE>
<LINE>And, let your father make her the assurance,</LINE>
<LINE>She is your own; else, you must pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>if you should die before him, where's her dower?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may not young men die, as well as old?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter Katharina is to be married:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</LINE>
<LINE>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, Signior Gremio:</LINE>
<LINE>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Adieu, good neighbour.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BAPTISTA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now I fear thee not:</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee all, and in his waning age</LINE>
<LINE>Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!</LINE>
<LINE>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis in my head to do my master good:</LINE>
<LINE>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio</LINE>
<LINE>Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'</LINE>
<LINE>And that's a wonder: fathers commonly</LINE>
<LINE>Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,</LINE>
<LINE>A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</LINE>

<LINE>Have you so soon forgot the entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, wrangling pedant, this is</LINE>
<LINE>The patroness of heavenly harmony:</LINE>
<LINE>Then give me leave to have prerogative;</LINE>
<LINE>And when in music we have spent an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Preposterous ass, that never read so far</LINE>
<LINE>To know the cause why music was ordain'd!</LINE>
<LINE>Was it not to refresh the mind of man</LINE>
<LINE>After his studies or his usual pain?</LINE>
<LINE>Then give me leave to read philosophy,</LINE>
<LINE>And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>To strive for that which resteth in my choice:</LINE>
<LINE>I am no breeching scholar in the schools;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,</LINE>
<LINE>But learn my lessons as I please myself.</LINE>
<LINE>And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:</LINE>
<LINE>Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;</LINE>
<LINE>His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</LINE>

<LINE>Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat</LINE>
<LINE>Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must believe my master; else, I promise you,</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, before you touch the instrument,</LINE>

<LINE>I must begin with rudiments of art;</LINE>
<LINE>To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,</LINE>
<LINE>More pleasant, pithy and effectual,</LINE>

<LINE>Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.</LINE>
<LINE>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</LINE>

<LINE>Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</LINE>
<LINE>Whatever fortune stays him from his word:</LINE>

<LINE>Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, master! news, old news, and such news as</LINE>
<LINE>you never heard of!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it new and old too? how may that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, no, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When will he be here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But say, what to thine old news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old</LINE>
<LINE>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair</LINE>
<LINE>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,</LINE>
<LINE>another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the</LINE>
<LINE>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;</LINE>
<LINE>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an</LINE>
<LINE>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;</LINE>
<LINE>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose</LINE>
<LINE>in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected</LINE>
<LINE>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with</LINE>
<LINE>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,</LINE>
<LINE>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the</LINE>
<LINE>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;</LINE>
<LINE>near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit</LINE>
<LINE>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being</LINE>
<LINE>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been</LINE>
<LINE>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth</LINE>
<LINE>six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,</LINE>
<LINE>which hath two letters for her name fairly set down</LINE>
<LINE>in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who comes with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</LINE>
<LINE>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a</LINE>
<LINE>kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red</LINE>
<LINE>and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty</LINE>
<LINE>fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a</LINE>
<LINE>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</LINE>
<LINE>footboy or a gentleman's lackey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, he comes not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou not say he comes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that Petruchio came.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's all one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by Saint Jamy,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold you a penny,</LINE>
<LINE>A horse and a man</LINE>
<LINE>Is more than one,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not many.</LINE>

<LINE>Not so well apparell'd</LINE>
<LINE>As I wish you were.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it better, I should rush in thus.</LINE>
<LINE>But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?</LINE>
<LINE>How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore gaze this goodly company,</LINE>
<LINE>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Some comet or unusual prodigy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:</LINE>
<LINE>First were we sad, fearing you would not come;</LINE>
<LINE>Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,</LINE>
<LINE>An eye-sore to our solemn festival!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And tells us, what occasion of import</LINE>
<LINE>Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:</LINE>
<LINE>Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in some part enforced to digress;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse</LINE>
<LINE>As you shall well be satisfied withal.</LINE>
<LINE>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:</LINE>
<LINE>The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See not your bride in these unreverent robes:</LINE>
<LINE>Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:</LINE>
<LINE>To me she's married, not unto my clothes:</LINE>
<LINE>Could I repair what she will wear in me,</LINE>
<LINE>As I can change these poor accoutrements,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</LINE>
<LINE>But what a fool am I to chat with you,</LINE>
<LINE>When I should bid good morrow to my bride,</LINE>

<LINE>I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,</LINE>
<LINE>It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--</LINE>
<LINE>And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;</LINE>
<LINE>And make assurance here in Padua</LINE>
<LINE>Of greater sums than I have promised.</LINE>
<LINE>So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it not that my fellow-school-master</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That by degrees we mean to look into,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</LINE>
<LINE>Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,</LINE>
<LINE>That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,</LINE>
<LINE>The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff</LINE>
<LINE>That down fell priest and book and book and priest:</LINE>
<LINE>'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What said the wench when he rose again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</LINE>
<LINE>But after many ceremonies done,</LINE>
<LINE>He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if</LINE>
<LINE>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</LINE>
<LINE>After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel</LINE>
<LINE>And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;</LINE>
<LINE>Having no other reason</LINE>
<LINE>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly</LINE>
<LINE>And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.</LINE>
<LINE>This done, he took the bride about the neck</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack</LINE>
<LINE>That at the parting all the church did echo:</LINE>
<LINE>And I seeing this came thence for very shame;</LINE>
<LINE>And after me, I know, the rout is coming.</LINE>
<LINE>Such a mad marriage never was before:</LINE>

<LINE>warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon</LINE>
<LINE>hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my</LINE>
<LINE>tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my</LINE>
<LINE>belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,</LINE>
<LINE>thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she</LINE>
<LINE>under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how</LINE>
<LINE>miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her</LINE>
<LINE>with the horse upon her, how he beat me because</LINE>
<LINE>her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt</LINE>
<LINE>to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,</LINE>
<LINE>that never prayed before, how I cried, how the</LINE>
<LINE>horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I</LINE>
<LINE>lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,</LINE>
<LINE>which now shall die in oblivion and thou return</LINE>
<LINE>unexperienced to thy grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>For then she never looks upon her lure.</LINE>
<LINE>Another way I have to man my haggard,</LINE>
<LINE>To make her come and know her keeper's call,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</LINE>
<LINE>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.</LINE>
<LINE>She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;</LINE>
<LINE>Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;</LINE>
<LINE>As with the meat, some undeserved fault</LINE>
<LINE>I'll find about the making of the bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</LINE>
<LINE>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and amid this hurly I intend</LINE>
<LINE>That all is done in reverend care of her;</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion she shall watch all night:</LINE>
<LINE>And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl</LINE>
<LINE>And with the clamour keep her still awake.</LINE>
<LINE>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;</LINE>

<LINE>As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.</LINE>

<LINE>His name and credit shall you undertake,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:</LINE>
<LINE>Look that you take upon you as you should;</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me, sir: so shall you stay</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear it is too choleric a meat.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.</LINE>
<LINE>What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dish that I do love to feed upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else you get no beef of Grumio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, the mustard without the beef.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,</LINE>

<LINE>Will we return unto thy father's house</LINE>
<LINE>And revel it as bravely as the best,</LINE>
<LINE>With silken coats and caps and golden rings,</LINE>
<LINE>With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;</LINE>
<LINE>With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,</LINE>

<LINE>What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Haberdasher</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this was moulded on a porringer;</LINE>
<LINE>A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,</LINE>
<LINE>A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:</LINE>
<LINE>Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,</LINE>
<LINE>And gentlewomen wear such caps as these</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When you are gentle, you shall have one too,</LINE>
<LINE>And not till then.</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  That will not be in haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;</LINE>
<LINE>And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:</LINE>
<LINE>Your betters have endured me say my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else my heart concealing it will break,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather than it shall, I will be free</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,</LINE>
<LINE>A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love me or love me not, I like the cap;</LINE>

<LINE>O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?</LINE>
<LINE>What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:</LINE>
<LINE>What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?</LINE>
<LINE>Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a censer in a barber's shop:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bid me make it orderly and well,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the fashion and the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,</LINE>

<LINE>I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship is deceived; the gown is made</LINE>
<LINE>Just as my master had direction:</LINE>
<LINE>Grumio gave order how it should be done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>But how did you desire it should be made?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Marry, sir, with needle and thread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not</LINE>

<LINE>thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did</LINE>
<LINE>not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in</LINE>

<LINE>Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's</LINE>

<LINE>For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>So honour peereth in the meanest habit.</LINE>
<LINE>What is the jay more precious than the lark,</LINE>
<LINE>Because his fathers are more beautiful?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is the adder better than the eel,</LINE>

<LINE>O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse</LINE>

<LINE>if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, what else? and but I be deceived</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista may remember me,</LINE>
<LINE>Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,</LINE>
<LINE>Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, fear not me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I told him that your father was at Venice,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft son!</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua</LINE>
<LINE>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</LINE>
<LINE>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of love between your daughter and himself:</LINE>
<LINE>And, for the good report I hear of you</LINE>
<LINE>And for the love he beareth to your daughter</LINE>
<LINE>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</LINE>
<LINE>I am content, in a good father's care,</LINE>
<LINE>To have him match'd; and if you please to like</LINE>
<LINE>No worse than I, upon some agreement</LINE>
<LINE>Me shall you find ready and willing</LINE>
<LINE>With one consent to have her so bestow'd;</LINE>
<LINE>For curious I cannot be with you,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:</LINE>
<LINE>Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</LINE>
<LINE>Right true it is, your son Lucentio here</LINE>
<LINE>Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,</LINE>
<LINE>Or both dissemble deeply their affections:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, if you say no more than this,</LINE>
<LINE>That like a father you will deal with him</LINE>
<LINE>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</LINE>
<LINE>The match is made, and all is done:</LINE>
<LINE>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,</LINE>

<LINE>Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;</LINE>
<LINE>And happily we might be interrupted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then at my lodging, an it like you:</LINE>
<LINE>There doth my father lie; and there, this night,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll pass the business privately and well.</LINE>
<LINE>Send for your daughter by your servant here:</LINE>
<LINE>My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</LINE>
<LINE>The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,</LINE>
<LINE>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good swift simile, but something currish.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She will not.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.</LINE>
<LINE>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,</LINE>
<LINE>And awful rule and right supremacy;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!</LINE>
<LINE>The wager thou hast won; and I will add</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;</LINE>
<LINE>Another dowry to another daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>For she is changed, as she had never been.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will win my wager better yet</LINE>
<LINE>And show more sign of her obedience,</LINE>
<LINE>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</LINE>
<LINE>See where she comes and brings your froward wives</LINE>
<LINE>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:</LINE>
<LINE>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your duty were as foolish too:</LINE>
<LINE>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more fool you, for laying on my duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women</LINE>
<LINE>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say she shall: and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</LINE>
<LINE>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</LINE>
<LINE>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</LINE>
<LINE>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</LINE>
<LINE>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</LINE>
<LINE>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</LINE>
<LINE>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</LINE>
<LINE>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy maintenance commits his body</LINE>
<LINE>To painful labour both by sea and land,</LINE>
<LINE>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</LINE>
<LINE>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</LINE>
<LINE>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</LINE>
<LINE>Too little payment for so great a debt.</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</LINE>
<LINE>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</LINE>
<LINE>And not obedient to his honest will,</LINE>
<LINE>What is she but a foul contending rebel</LINE>
<LINE>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</LINE>
<LINE>I am ashamed that women are so simple</LINE>
<LINE>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</LINE>
<LINE>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</LINE>
<LINE>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</LINE>
<LINE>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</LINE>
<LINE>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Should well agree with our external parts?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</LINE>
<LINE>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</LINE>
<LINE>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I see our lances are but straws,</LINE>
<LINE>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</LINE>
<LINE>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</LINE>
<LINE>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</LINE>
<LINE>And place your hands below your husband's foot:</LINE>
<LINE>In token of which duty, if he please,</LINE>
<LINE>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, we'll to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>We three are married, but you two are sped.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To LUCENTIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;</LINE>
<LINE>And, being a winner, God give you good night!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Verona. A public place.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, for then we should be colliers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I strike quickly, being moved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</LINE>
<LINE>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</LINE>
<LINE>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</LINE>
<LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</LINE>
<LINE>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</LINE>
<LINE>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</LINE>
<LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</LINE>
<LINE>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</LINE>
<LINE>maids, and cut off their heads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heads of the maids?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</LINE>
<LINE>take it in what sense thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They must take it in sense that feel it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</LINE>
<LINE>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</LINE>
<LINE>two of the house of the Montagues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! turn thy back and run?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear me not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, marry; I fear thee!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</LINE>
<LINE>they list.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</LINE>
<LINE>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</LINE>

<LINE>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</LINE>

<LINE>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</LINE>
<LINE>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</LINE>
<LINE>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</LINE>
<LINE>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</LINE>
<LINE>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And made Verona's ancient citizens</LINE>
<LINE>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</LINE>

<LINE>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here were the servants of your adversary,</LINE>
<LINE>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</LINE>
<LINE>I drew to part them: in the instant came</LINE>
<LINE>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</LINE>
<LINE>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</LINE>
<LINE>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</LINE>
<LINE>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</LINE>
<LINE>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</LINE>
<LINE>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</LINE>
<LINE>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</LINE>
<LINE>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</LINE>
<LINE>So early walking did I see your son:</LINE>
<LINE>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</LINE>
<LINE>And stole into the covert of the wood:</LINE>
<LINE>I, measuring his affections by my own,</LINE>
<LINE>That most are busied when they're most alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</LINE>
<LINE>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</LINE>
<LINE>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</LINE>
<LINE>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</LINE>
<LINE>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</LINE>
<LINE>And private in his chamber pens himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</LINE>
<LINE>And makes himself an artificial night:</LINE>
<LINE>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you importuned him by any means?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both by myself and many other friends:</LINE>
<LINE>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</LINE>
<LINE>Is to himself--I will not say how true--</LINE>
<LINE>But to himself so secret and so close,</LINE>
<LINE>So far from sounding and discovery,</LINE>
<LINE>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</LINE>
<LINE>We would as willingly give cure as know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But new struck nine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me! sad hours seem long.</LINE>
<LINE>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</LINE>
<LINE>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</LINE>
<LINE>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</LINE>
<LINE>O any thing, of nothing first create!</LINE>
<LINE>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</LINE>
<LINE>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</LINE>
<LINE>sick health!</LINE>
<LINE>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</LINE>
<LINE>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not laugh?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, coz, I rather weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good heart, at what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At thy good heart's oppression.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, such is love's transgression.</LINE>
<LINE>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</LINE>
<LINE>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</LINE>
<LINE>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</LINE>
<LINE>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:</LINE>
<LINE>What is it else? a madness most discreet,</LINE>
<LINE>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my coz.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft! I will go along;</LINE>
<LINE>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;</LINE>
<LINE>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Groan! why, no.</LINE>
<LINE>But sadly tell me who.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!</LINE>
<LINE>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit</LINE>
<LINE>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,</LINE>
<LINE>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.</LINE>
<LINE>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</LINE>
<LINE>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</LINE>
<LINE>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty starved with her severity</LINE>
<LINE>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</LINE>
<LINE>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</LINE>
<LINE>To merit bliss by making me despair:</LINE>
<LINE>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</LINE>
<LINE>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, teach me how I should forget to think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>Examine other beauties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis the way</LINE>
<LINE>To call hers exquisite, in question more:</LINE>
<LINE>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows</LINE>
<LINE>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;</LINE>
<LINE>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</LINE>
<LINE>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</LINE>
<LINE>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</LINE>
<LINE>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</LINE>
<LINE>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But Montague is bound as well as I,</LINE>

<LINE>For men so old as we to keep the peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of honourable reckoning are you both;</LINE>
<LINE>And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.</LINE>
<LINE>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But saying o'er what I have said before:</LINE>
<LINE>My child is yet a stranger in the world;</LINE>
<LINE>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,</LINE>
<LINE>Let two more summers wither in their pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Younger than she are happy mothers made.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.</LINE>
<LINE>The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,</LINE>
<LINE>She is the hopeful lady of my earth:</LINE>
<LINE>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>My will to her consent is but a part;</LINE>
<LINE>An she agree, within her scope of choice</LINE>
<LINE>Lies my consent and fair according voice.</LINE>
<LINE>This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto I have invited many a guest,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as I love; and you, among the store,</LINE>
<LINE>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.</LINE>
<LINE>At my poor house look to behold this night</LINE>
<LINE>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:</LINE>
<LINE>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel</LINE>
<LINE>When well-apparell'd April on the heel</LINE>
<LINE>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</LINE>
<LINE>Among fresh female buds shall you this night</LINE>
<LINE>Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,</LINE>
<LINE>And like her most whose merit most shall be:</LINE>
<LINE>Which on more view, of many mine being one</LINE>
<LINE>May stand in number, though in reckoning none,</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go with me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Servant, giving a paper</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go, sirrah, trudge about</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Find them out whose names are written here! It is</LINE>
<LINE>written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his</LINE>
<LINE>yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with</LINE>
<LINE>his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am</LINE>
<LINE>sent to find those persons whose names are here</LINE>
<LINE>writ, and can never find what names the writing</LINE>
<LINE>person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.</LINE>

<LINE>One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;</LINE>
<LINE>Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;</LINE>
<LINE>One desperate grief cures with another's languish:</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, I am here.</LINE>
<LINE>What is your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;</LINE>
<LINE>I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's not fourteen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--</LINE>
<LINE>She is not fourteen. How long is it now</LINE>
<LINE>To Lammas-tide?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fortnight and odd days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</LINE>
<LINE>Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.</LINE>
<LINE>Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--</LINE>
<LINE>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;</LINE>
<LINE>She was too good for me: but, as I said,</LINE>
<LINE>On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;</LINE>
<LINE>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</LINE>
<LINE>And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</LINE>
<LINE>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</LINE>
<LINE>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;</LINE>
<LINE>My lord and you were then at Mantua:--</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,</LINE>
<LINE>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</LINE>
<LINE>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</LINE>
<LINE>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</LINE>
<LINE>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,</LINE>
<LINE>To bid me trudge:</LINE>
<LINE>And since that time it is eleven years;</LINE>
<LINE>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,</LINE>
<LINE>She could have run and waddled all about;</LINE>
<LINE>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</LINE>
<LINE>And then my husband--God be with his soul!</LINE>
<LINE>A' was a merry man--took up the child:</LINE>
<LINE>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
<LINE>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</LINE>
<LINE>I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;</LINE>
<LINE>And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,</LINE>
<LINE>To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</LINE>
<LINE>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;</LINE>
<LINE>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</LINE>
<LINE>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:</LINE>
<LINE>An I might live to see thee married once,</LINE>
<LINE>I have my wish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme</LINE>
<LINE>I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>How stands your disposition to be married?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is an honour that I dream not of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An honour! were not I thine only nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,</LINE>
<LINE>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Are made already mothers: by my count,</LINE>
<LINE>I was your mother much upon these years</LINE>
<LINE>That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:</LINE>
<LINE>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man, young lady! lady, such a man</LINE>
<LINE>As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verona's summer hath not such a flower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you? can you love the gentleman?</LINE>
<LINE>This night you shall behold him at our feast;</LINE>
<LINE>Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,</LINE>
<LINE>And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;</LINE>
<LINE>Examine every married lineament,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how one another lends content</LINE>
<LINE>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</LINE>
<LINE>Find written in the margent of his eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</LINE>
<LINE>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:</LINE>
<LINE>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride</LINE>
<LINE>For fair without the fair within to hide:</LINE>
<LINE>That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,</LINE>
<LINE>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall you share all that he doth possess,</LINE>
<LINE>By having him, making yourself no less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll look to like, if looking liking move:</LINE>
<LINE>But no more deep will I endart mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  A street.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we on without a apology?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The date is out of such prolixity:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,</LINE>
<LINE>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke</LINE>
<LINE>After the prompter, for our entrance:</LINE>
<LINE>But let them measure us by what they will;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;</LINE>
<LINE>Being but heavy, I will bear the light.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes</LINE>
<LINE>With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead</LINE>
<LINE>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,</LINE>
<LINE>And soar with them above a common bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft</LINE>
<LINE>To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:</LINE>
<LINE>Under love's heavy burden do I sink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;</LINE>
<LINE>Too great oppression for a tender thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,</LINE>
<LINE>Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;</LINE>
<LINE>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a case to put my visage in:</LINE>
<LINE>A visor for a visor! what care I</LINE>
<LINE>What curious eye doth quote deformities?</LINE>
<LINE>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,</LINE>
<LINE>But every man betake him to his legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A torch for me: let wantons light of heart</LINE>
<LINE>Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.</LINE>
<LINE>The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire</LINE>
<LINE>Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st</LINE>
<LINE>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, sir, in delay</LINE>
<LINE>We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.</LINE>
<LINE>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits</LINE>
<LINE>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And we mean well in going to this mask;</LINE>
<LINE>But 'tis no wit to go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, may one ask?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dream'd a dream to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so did I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what was yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That dreamers often lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</LINE>
<LINE>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes</LINE>
<LINE>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</LINE>
<LINE>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn with a team of little atomies</LINE>
<LINE>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</LINE>
<LINE>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</LINE>
<LINE>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</LINE>
<LINE>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</LINE>
<LINE>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</LINE>
<LINE>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</LINE>
<LINE>Not so big as a round little worm</LINE>
<LINE>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;</LINE>
<LINE>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</LINE>
<LINE>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</LINE>
<LINE>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</LINE>
<LINE>And in this state she gallops night by night</LINE>
<LINE>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</LINE>
<LINE>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</LINE>
<LINE>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</LINE>
<LINE>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</LINE>
<LINE>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</LINE>
<LINE>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</LINE>
<LINE>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</LINE>
<LINE>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</LINE>
<LINE>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</LINE>
<LINE>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Making them women of good carriage:</LINE>
<LINE>This is she--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou talk'st of nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, I talk of dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are the children of an idle brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as thin of substance as the air</LINE>
<LINE>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes</LINE>
<LINE>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;</LINE>
<LINE>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives</LINE>
<LINE>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</LINE>
<LINE>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date</LINE>
<LINE>With this night's revels and expire the term</LINE>
<LINE>Of a despised life closed in my breast</LINE>
<LINE>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.</LINE>
<LINE>But He, that hath the steerage of my course,</LINE>
<LINE>Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.</LINE>

<LINE>Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,</LINE>
<LINE>She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day</LINE>
<LINE>That I have worn a visor and could tell</LINE>
<LINE>A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:</LINE>
<LINE>You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.</LINE>

<LINE>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</LINE>
<LINE>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</LINE>
<LINE>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!</LINE>
<LINE>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</LINE>
<LINE>As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.</LINE>
<LINE>The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,</LINE>
<LINE>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!</LINE>

<LINE>He bears him like a portly gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him</LINE>
<LINE>To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:</LINE>
<LINE>I would not for the wealth of all the town</LINE>
<LINE>Here in my house do him disparagement:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be patient, take no note of him:</LINE>
<LINE>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</LINE>
<LINE>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.</LINE>

<LINE>You'll make a mutiny among my guests!</LINE>
<LINE>You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!</LINE>

<LINE>Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.</LINE>

<LINE>You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;</LINE>

<LINE>Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.</LINE>

<LINE>My only love sprung from my only hate!</LINE>
<LINE>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!</LINE>
<LINE>Prodigious birth of love it is to me,</LINE>

<LINE>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,</LINE>
<LINE>And young affection gapes to be his heir;</LINE>
<LINE>That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,</LINE>
<LINE>With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.</LINE>
<LINE>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,</LINE>
<LINE>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,</LINE>
<LINE>But to his foe supposed he must complain,</LINE>
<LINE>And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:</LINE>
<LINE>Being held a foe, he may not have access</LINE>
<LINE>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;</LINE>
<LINE>And she as much in love, her means much less</LINE>
<LINE>To meet her new-beloved any where:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can I go forward when my heart is here?</LINE>

<LINE>Romeo! my cousin Romeo!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is wise;</LINE>
<LINE>And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:</LINE>
<LINE>Call, good Mercutio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll conjure too.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!</LINE>
<LINE>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;</LINE>
<LINE>Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,</LINE>
<LINE>One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,</LINE>
<LINE>When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!</LINE>
<LINE>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;</LINE>
<LINE>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.</LINE>
<LINE>I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,</LINE>
<LINE>By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh</LINE>
<LINE>And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,</LINE>
<LINE>That in thy likeness thou appear to us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him</LINE>
<LINE>To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle</LINE>
<LINE>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand</LINE>
<LINE>Till she had laid it and conjured it down;</LINE>
<LINE>That were some spite: my invocation</LINE>
<LINE>Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name</LINE>
<LINE>I conjure only but to raise up him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,</LINE>
<LINE>To be consorted with the humorous night:</LINE>
<LINE>Blind is his love and best befits the dark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will he sit under a medlar tree,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit</LINE>
<LINE>As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, that she were, O, that she were</LINE>
<LINE>An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;</LINE>
<LINE>This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:</LINE>
<LINE>Come, shall we go?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>JULIET appears above at a window</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?</LINE>
<LINE>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:</LINE>
<LINE>Be not her maid, since she is envious;</LINE>
<LINE>Her vestal livery is but sick and green</LINE>
<LINE>And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.</LINE>
<LINE>It is my lady, O, it is my love!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that she knew she were!</LINE>
<LINE>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?</LINE>
<LINE>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.</LINE>
<LINE>I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:</LINE>
<LINE>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</LINE>
<LINE>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</LINE>
<LINE>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</LINE>
<LINE>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</LINE>
<LINE>As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Would through the airy region stream so bright</LINE>
<LINE>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</LINE>
<LINE>See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That I might touch that cheek!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She speaks:</LINE>
<LINE>O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art</LINE>
<LINE>As glorious to this night, being o'er my head</LINE>
<LINE>As is a winged messenger of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</LINE>
<LINE>When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds</LINE>
<LINE>And sails upon the bosom of the air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?</LINE>
<LINE>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll no longer be a Capulet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part</LINE>
<LINE>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</LINE>
<LINE>What's in a name? that which we call a rose</LINE>
<LINE>By any other name would smell as sweet;</LINE>
<LINE>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</LINE>
<LINE>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>And for that name which is no part of thee</LINE>
<LINE>Take all myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take thee at thy word:</LINE>
<LINE>Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night</LINE>
<LINE>So stumblest on my counsel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By a name</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how to tell thee who I am:</LINE>
<LINE>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Because it is an enemy to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words</LINE>
<LINE>Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</LINE>
<LINE>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</LINE>
<LINE>And the place death, considering who thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;</LINE>
<LINE>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</LINE>
<LINE>And what love can do that dares love attempt;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am proof against their enmity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not for the world they saw thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;</LINE>
<LINE>And but thou love me, let them find me here:</LINE>
<LINE>My life were better ended by their hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By whose direction found'st thou out this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;</LINE>
<LINE>He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</LINE>
<LINE>As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,</LINE>
<LINE>I would adventure for such merchandise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</LINE>
<LINE>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</LINE>
<LINE>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'</LINE>
<LINE>And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries</LINE>
<LINE>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</LINE>
<LINE>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:</LINE>
<LINE>But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true</LINE>
<LINE>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</LINE>
<LINE>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,</LINE>
<LINE>My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>And not impute this yielding to light love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear</LINE>
<LINE>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,</LINE>
<LINE>That monthly changes in her circled orb,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I swear by?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not swear at all;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the god of my idolatry,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll believe thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my heart's dear love--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no joy of this contract to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;</LINE>
<LINE>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</LINE>
<LINE>Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!</LINE>
<LINE>This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,</LINE>
<LINE>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest</LINE>
<LINE>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I would it were to give again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to be frank, and give it thee again.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I wish but for the thing I have:</LINE>
<LINE>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>My love as deep; the more I give to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>The more I have, for both are infinite.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Nurse calls within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.</LINE>

<LINE>Many for many virtues excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>None but for some and yet all different.</LINE>
<LINE>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</LINE>
<LINE>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</LINE>
<LINE>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</LINE>
<LINE>But to the earth some special good doth give,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</LINE>
<LINE>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</LINE>
<LINE>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</LINE>
<LINE>Within the infant rind of this small flower</LINE>
<LINE>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</LINE>
<LINE>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</LINE>
<LINE>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</LINE>
<LINE>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;</LINE>
<LINE>And where the worser is predominant,</LINE>
<LINE>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</LINE>

<LINE>Benedicite!</LINE>
<LINE>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</LINE>
<LINE>Young son, it argues a distemper'd head</LINE>
<LINE>So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:</LINE>
<LINE>Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;</LINE>
<LINE>But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain</LINE>
<LINE>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;</LINE>

<LINE>Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</LINE>

<LINE>That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.</LINE>
<LINE>I have been feasting with mine enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,</LINE>
<LINE>That's by me wounded: both our remedies</LINE>
<LINE>Within thy help and holy physic lies:</LINE>
<LINE>I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,</LINE>
<LINE>My intercession likewise steads my foe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:</LINE>
<LINE>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And all combined, save what thou must combine</LINE>
<LINE>By holy marriage: when and where and how</LINE>
<LINE>We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou consent to marry us to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</LINE>
<LINE>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</LINE>
<LINE>So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies</LINE>
<LINE>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</LINE>
<LINE>Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</LINE>
<LINE>How much salt water thrown away in waste,</LINE>
<LINE>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</LINE>
<LINE>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</LINE>
<LINE>Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:</LINE>
<LINE>If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:</LINE>
<LINE>And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,</LINE>
<LINE>Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she knew well</LINE>
<LINE>Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.</LINE>
<LINE>But come, young waverer, come, go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>In one respect I'll thy assistant be;</LINE>
<LINE>For this alliance may so happy prove,</LINE>

<LINE>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>

<LINE>was I with you there for the goose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast</LINE>

<LINE>now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art</LINE>

<LINE>In half an hour she promised to return.</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.</LINE>
<LINE>O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Driving back shadows over louring hills:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</LINE>
<LINE>Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve</LINE>
<LINE>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</LINE>
<LINE>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</LINE>
<LINE>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;</LINE>
<LINE>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</LINE>
<LINE>And his to me:</LINE>
<LINE>But old folks, many feign as they were dead;</LINE>
<LINE>Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.</LINE>
<LINE>O God, she comes!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Nurse and PETER</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O honey nurse, what news?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peter, stay at the gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit PETER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?</LINE>
<LINE>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;</LINE>
<LINE>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news</LINE>
<LINE>By playing it to me with so sour a face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?</LINE>
<LINE>Do you not see that I am out of breath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath</LINE>
<LINE>To say to me that thou art out of breath?</LINE>
<LINE>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay</LINE>
<LINE>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.</LINE>
<LINE>Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;</LINE>
<LINE>Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not</LINE>
<LINE>how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his</LINE>
<LINE>face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels</LINE>
<LINE>all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,</LINE>
<LINE>though they be not to be talked on, yet they are</LINE>
<LINE>past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy</LINE>
<LINE>ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no: but all this did I know before.</LINE>
<LINE>What says he of our marriage? what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!</LINE>
<LINE>It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.</LINE>
<LINE>My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!</LINE>
<LINE>Beshrew your heart for sending me about,</LINE>
<LINE>To catch my death with jaunting up and down!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a</LINE>
<LINE>courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I</LINE>
<LINE>warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is my mother! why, she is within;</LINE>
<LINE>Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!</LINE>
<LINE>'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is your mother?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God's lady dear!</LINE>
<LINE>Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the poultice for my aching bones?</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforward do your messages yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;</LINE>
<LINE>There stays a husband to make you a wife:</LINE>
<LINE>Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.</LINE>
<LINE>Hie you to church; I must another way,</LINE>
<LINE>To fetch a ladder, by the which your love</LINE>
<LINE>Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the drudge and toil in your delight,</LINE>
<LINE>But you shall bear the burden soon at night.</LINE>
<LINE>Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,</LINE>
<LINE>That after hours with sorrow chide us not!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy</LINE>
<LINE>That one short minute gives me in her sight:</LINE>
<LINE>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,</LINE>
<LINE>Then love-devouring death do what he dare;</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough I may but call her mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These violent delights have violent ends</LINE>
<LINE>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,</LINE>
<LINE>Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey</LINE>
<LINE>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness</LINE>
<LINE>And in the taste confounds the appetite:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;</LINE>
<LINE>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter JULIET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot</LINE>
<LINE>Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:</LINE>
<LINE>A lover may bestride the gossamer</LINE>
<LINE>That idles in the wanton summer air,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not fall; so light is vanity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good even to my ghostly confessor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As much to him, else is his thanks too much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy</LINE>
<LINE>Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more</LINE>
<LINE>To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath</LINE>
<LINE>This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Unfold the imagined happiness that both</LINE>
<LINE>Receive in either by this dear encounter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,</LINE>
<LINE>Brags of his substance, not of ornament:</LINE>
<LINE>They are but beggars that can count their worth;</LINE>
<LINE>But my true love is grown to such excess</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come with me, and we will make short work;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:</LINE>
<LINE>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;</LINE>
<LINE>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he</LINE>
<LINE>enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword</LINE>
<LINE>upon the table and says 'God send me no need of</LINE>
<LINE>thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws</LINE>
<LINE>it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I like such a fellow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as</LINE>
<LINE>any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as</LINE>
<LINE>soon moody to be moved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what to?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none</LINE>
<LINE>shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,</LINE>
<LINE>thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,</LINE>
<LINE>or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no</LINE>
<LINE>other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what</LINE>
<LINE>eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</LINE>
<LINE>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as</LINE>
<LINE>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a</LINE>
<LINE>man for coughing in the street, because he hath</LINE>
<LINE>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:</LINE>
<LINE>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing</LINE>
<LINE>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for</LINE>
<LINE>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man</LINE>
<LINE>should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fee-simple! O simple!</LINE>

<LINE>Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And but one word with one of us? couple it with</LINE>
<LINE>something; make it a word and a blow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you</LINE>
<LINE>will give me occasion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Could you not take some occasion without giving?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an</LINE>
<LINE>thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but</LINE>
<LINE>discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall</LINE>
<LINE>make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We talk here in the public haunt of men:</LINE>
<LINE>Either withdraw unto some private place,</LINE>
<LINE>And reason coldly of your grievances,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MERCUTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;</LINE>
<LINE>Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford</LINE>
<LINE>No better term than this,--thou art a villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</LINE>
<LINE>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage</LINE>
<LINE>To such a greeting: villain am I none;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYBALT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries</LINE>
<LINE>That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do protest, I never injured thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But love thee better than thou canst devise,</LINE>

<LINE>As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.</LINE>

<LINE>Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine</LINE>
<LINE>lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you</LINE>
<LINE>shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the</LINE>

<LINE>by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your</LINE>

<LINE>me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I</LINE>
<LINE>am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'</LINE>
<LINE>both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a</LINE>
<LINE>cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter TYBALT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,</LINE>
<LINE>That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a little way above our heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Staying for thine to keep him company:</LINE>
<LINE>Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble prince, I can discover all</LINE>
<LINE>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:</LINE>
<LINE>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!</LINE>
<LINE>O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt</LINE>
<LINE>O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</LINE>
<LINE>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>O cousin, cousin!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</LINE>
<LINE>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal</LINE>
<LINE>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</LINE>
<LINE>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</LINE>
<LINE>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</LINE>
<LINE>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</LINE>
<LINE>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,</LINE>
<LINE>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than</LINE>
<LINE>his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</LINE>
<LINE>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</LINE>
<LINE>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</LINE>
<LINE>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I</LINE>
<LINE>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</LINE>
<LINE>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a kinsman to the Montague;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:</LINE>
<LINE>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</LINE>
<LINE>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</LINE>
<LINE>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;</LINE>
<LINE>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;</LINE>
<LINE>His fault concludes but what the law should end,</LINE>
<LINE>The life of Tybalt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for that offence</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately we do exile him hence:</LINE>
<LINE>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,</LINE>
<LINE>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</LINE>
<LINE>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine</LINE>
<LINE>That you shall all repent the loss of mine:</LINE>
<LINE>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,</LINE>
<LINE>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</LINE>
<LINE>Bear hence this body and attend our will:</LINE>
<LINE>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter JULIET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner</LINE>
<LINE>As Phaethon would whip you to the west,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</LINE>
<LINE>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</LINE>
<LINE>That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.</LINE>
<LINE>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</LINE>
<LINE>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,</LINE>
<LINE>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</LINE>
<LINE>And learn me how to lose a winning match,</LINE>
<LINE>Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:</LINE>
<LINE>Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Think true love acted simple modesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</LINE>
<LINE>Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,</LINE>
<LINE>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</LINE>
<LINE>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</LINE>
<LINE>That all the world will be in love with night</LINE>
<LINE>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</LINE>
<LINE>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,</LINE>
<LINE>But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,</LINE>
<LINE>Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day</LINE>
<LINE>As is the night before some festival</LINE>
<LINE>To an impatient child that hath new robes</LINE>
<LINE>And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Nurse, with cords</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords</LINE>
<LINE>That Romeo bid thee fetch?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, the cords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Throws them down</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!</LINE>
<LINE>We are undone, lady, we are undone!</LINE>
<LINE>Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can heaven be so envious?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo can,</LINE>
<LINE>Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!</LINE>
<LINE>Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?</LINE>
<LINE>This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.</LINE>
<LINE>Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'</LINE>
<LINE>And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more</LINE>
<LINE>Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:</LINE>
<LINE>I am not I, if there be such an I;</LINE>
<LINE>Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'</LINE>
<LINE>If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:</LINE>
<LINE>Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--</LINE>
<LINE>God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:</LINE>
<LINE>A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;</LINE>
<LINE>Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,</LINE>
<LINE>All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!</LINE>
<LINE>To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!</LINE>
<LINE>Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!</LINE>
<LINE>O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!</LINE>
<LINE>That ever I should live to see thee dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What storm is this that blows so contrary?</LINE>
<LINE>Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?</LINE>
<LINE>My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?</LINE>
<LINE>Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!</LINE>
<LINE>For who is living, if those two are gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It did, it did; alas the day, it did!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?</LINE>
<LINE>Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!</LINE>
<LINE>Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!</LINE>
<LINE>Despised substance of divinest show!</LINE>
<LINE>Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,</LINE>
<LINE>A damned saint, an honourable villain!</LINE>
<LINE>O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend</LINE>
<LINE>In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?</LINE>
<LINE>Was ever book containing such vile matter</LINE>
<LINE>So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell</LINE>
<LINE>In such a gorgeous palace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no trust,</LINE>
<LINE>No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,</LINE>
<LINE>All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:</LINE>
<LINE>These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.</LINE>
<LINE>Shame come to Romeo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blister'd be thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>For such a wish! he was not born to shame:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd</LINE>
<LINE>Sole monarch of the universal earth.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?</LINE>
<LINE>But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</LINE>
<LINE>That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:</LINE>
<LINE>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</LINE>
<LINE>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</LINE>
<LINE>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;</LINE>
<LINE>And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:</LINE>
<LINE>All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?</LINE>
<LINE>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;</LINE>
<LINE>But, O, it presses to my memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'</LINE>
<LINE>That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'</LINE>
<LINE>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death</LINE>
<LINE>Was woe enough, if it had ended there:</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</LINE>
<LINE>And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,</LINE>
<LINE>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</LINE>
<LINE>But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,</LINE>
<LINE>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'</LINE>
<LINE>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</LINE>
<LINE>In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,</LINE>
<LINE>When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.</LINE>
<LINE>Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,</LINE>
<LINE>Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:</LINE>
<LINE>He made you for a highway to my bed;</LINE>
<LINE>But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>To comfort you: I wot well where he is.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:</LINE>
<LINE>Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou art wedded to calamity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?</LINE>
<LINE>What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That I yet know not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too familiar</LINE>
<LINE>Is my dear son with such sour company:</LINE>
<LINE>I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Not body's death, but body's banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'</LINE>
<LINE>For exile hath more terror in his look,</LINE>
<LINE>Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence from Verona art thou banished:</LINE>
<LINE>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no world without Verona walls,</LINE>
<LINE>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And world's exile is death: then banished,</LINE>
<LINE>Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,</LINE>
<LINE>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And turn'd that black word death to banishment:</LINE>
<LINE>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog</LINE>
<LINE>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</LINE>
<LINE>Live here in heaven and may look on her;</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo may not: more validity,</LINE>
<LINE>More honourable state, more courtship lives</LINE>
<LINE>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize</LINE>
<LINE>On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand</LINE>
<LINE>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo may not; he is banished:</LINE>
<LINE>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:</LINE>
<LINE>They are free men, but I am banished.</LINE>
<LINE>And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,</LINE>
<LINE>No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?</LINE>
<LINE>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</LINE>
<LINE>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</LINE>
<LINE>A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To mangle me with that word 'banished'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:</LINE>
<LINE>Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,</LINE>
<LINE>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!</LINE>
<LINE>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,</LINE>
<LINE>It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,</LINE>
<LINE>An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,</LINE>
<LINE>Doting like me and like me banished,</LINE>
<LINE>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall upon the ground, as I do now,</LINE>
<LINE>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</LINE>

<LINE>Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:</LINE>

<LINE>Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?</LINE>
<LINE>Doth she not think me an old murderer,</LINE>

<LINE>With blood removed but little from her own?</LINE>
<LINE>Where is she? and how doth she? and what says</LINE>
<LINE>My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;</LINE>
<LINE>And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,</LINE>
<LINE>And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,</LINE>
<LINE>And then down falls again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As if that name,</LINE>
<LINE>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,</LINE>
<LINE>Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand</LINE>

<LINE>Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold thy desperate hand:</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote</LINE>
<LINE>The unreasonable fury of a beast:</LINE>
<LINE>Unseemly woman in a seeming man!</LINE>
<LINE>Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought thy disposition better temper'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>By doing damned hate upon thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?</LINE>
<LINE>Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet</LINE>
<LINE>In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,</LINE>
<LINE>And usest none in that true use indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,</LINE>
<LINE>Digressing from the valour of a man;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,</LINE>
<LINE>Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,</LINE>
<LINE>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,</LINE>
<LINE>Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,</LINE>
<LINE>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.</LINE>
<LINE>What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,</LINE>
<LINE>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;</LINE>
<LINE>There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:</LINE>
<LINE>The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend</LINE>
<LINE>And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:</LINE>
<LINE>A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;</LINE>
<LINE>Happiness courts thee in her best array;</LINE>
<LINE>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:</LINE>
<LINE>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,</LINE>
<LINE>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;</LINE>
<LINE>Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time</LINE>
<LINE>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.</LINE>
<LINE>Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo is coming.</LINE>

<LINE>O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night</LINE>

<LINE>Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! what day is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monday, my lord,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</LINE>
<LINE>O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall be married to this noble earl.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be ready? do you like this haste?</LINE>
<LINE>We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;</LINE>
<LINE>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</LINE>
<LINE>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</LINE>
<LINE>Being our kinsman, if we revel much:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.</LINE>
<LINE>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>Afore me! it is so very very late,</LINE>
<LINE>That we may call it early by and by.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:</LINE>
<LINE>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</LINE>
<LINE>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;</LINE>
<LINE>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks</LINE>
<LINE>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:</LINE>
<LINE>Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day</LINE>
<LINE>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</LINE>
<LINE>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:</LINE>
<LINE>It is some meteor that the sun exhales,</LINE>
<LINE>To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,</LINE>
<LINE>And light thee on thy way to Mantua:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;</LINE>
<LINE>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</LINE>
<LINE>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:</LINE>
<LINE>I have more care to stay than will to go:</LINE>
<LINE>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.</LINE>
<LINE>How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!</LINE>
<LINE>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</LINE>
<LINE>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say the lark makes sweet division;</LINE>
<LINE>This doth not so, for she divideth us:</LINE>
<LINE>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>O, now I would they had changed voices too!</LINE>
<LINE>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</LINE>
<LINE>Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,</LINE>
<LINE>O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Nurse, to the chamber</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He goeth down</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!</LINE>
<LINE>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,</LINE>
<LINE>For in a minute there are many days:</LINE>
<LINE>O, by this count I shall be much in years</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I again behold my Romeo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>I will omit no opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve</LINE>
<LINE>For sweet discourses in our time to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,</LINE>
<LINE>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:</LINE>
<LINE>Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:</LINE>
<LINE>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.</LINE>
<LINE>That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;</LINE>
<LINE>For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,</LINE>
<LINE>But send him back.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?</LINE>
<LINE>Is she not down so late, or up so early?</LINE>
<LINE>What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LADY CAPULET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Juliet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I am not well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?</LINE>
<LINE>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</LINE>
<LINE>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;</LINE>
<LINE>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</LINE>
<LINE>Which you weep for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Feeling so the loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,</LINE>
<LINE>As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What villain madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That same villain, Romeo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--</LINE>
<LINE>God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</LINE>
<LINE>Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</LINE>
<LINE>Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:</LINE>
<LINE>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--</LINE>
<LINE>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, if you could find out but a man</LINE>
<LINE>To bear a poison, I would temper it;</LINE>
<LINE>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors</LINE>
<LINE>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.</LINE>
<LINE>To wreak the love I bore my cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his body that slaughter'd him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.</LINE>
<LINE>But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And joy comes well in such a needy time:</LINE>
<LINE>What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;</LINE>
<LINE>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,</LINE>
<LINE>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</LINE>
<LINE>I wonder at this haste; that I must wed</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how he will take it at your hands.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;</LINE>
<LINE>But for the sunset of my brother's son</LINE>
<LINE>It rains downright.</LINE>
<LINE>How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?</LINE>
<LINE>Evermore showering? In one little body</LINE>
<LINE>Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;</LINE>
<LINE>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,</LINE>
<LINE>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,</LINE>
<LINE>Without a sudden calm, will overset</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Have you deliver'd to her our decree?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.</LINE>
<LINE>I would the fool were married to her grave!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.</LINE>
<LINE>How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?</LINE>
<LINE>Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought</LINE>
<LINE>So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:</LINE>
<LINE>Proud can I never be of what I hate;</LINE>
<LINE>But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?</LINE>
<LINE>'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'</LINE>
<LINE>And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,</LINE>
<LINE>Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,</LINE>
<LINE>But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,</LINE>
<LINE>To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!</LINE>
<LINE>You tallow-face!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good father, I beseech you on my knees,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,</LINE>
<LINE>Or never after look me in the face:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;</LINE>
<LINE>My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest</LINE>
<LINE>That God had lent us but this only child;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I see this one is one too much,</LINE>
<LINE>And that we have a curse in having her:</LINE>
<LINE>Out on her, hilding!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God in heaven bless her!</LINE>
<LINE>You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I speak no treason.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Peace, you mumbling fool!</LINE>
<LINE>Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;</LINE>
<LINE>For here we need it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too hot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God's bread! it makes me mad:</LINE>
<LINE>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,</LINE>
<LINE>Alone, in company, still my care hath been</LINE>
<LINE>To have her match'd: and having now provided</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman of noble parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,</LINE>
<LINE>Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;</LINE>
<LINE>And then to have a wretched puling fool,</LINE>
<LINE>A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,</LINE>
<LINE>To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,</LINE>
<LINE>I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'</LINE>
<LINE>But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:</LINE>
<LINE>Graze where you will you shall not house with me:</LINE>
<LINE>Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.</LINE>
<LINE>Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:</LINE>
<LINE>An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;</LINE>
<LINE>And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in</LINE>
<LINE>the streets,</LINE>
<LINE>For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:</LINE>
<LINE>Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>That sees into the bottom of my grief?</LINE>
<LINE>O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!</LINE>
<LINE>Delay this marriage for a month, a week;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed</LINE>
<LINE>In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:</LINE>

<LINE>O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?</LINE>
<LINE>My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>How shall that faith return again to earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless that husband send it me from heaven</LINE>
<LINE>By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems</LINE>
<LINE>Upon so soft a subject as myself!</LINE>
<LINE>What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?</LINE>
<LINE>Some comfort, nurse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nurse</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, here it is.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,</LINE>
<LINE>I think it best you married with the county.</LINE>
<LINE>O, he's a lovely gentleman!</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye</LINE>
<LINE>As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,</LINE>
<LINE>I think you are happy in this second match,</LINE>
<LINE>For it excels your first: or if it did not,</LINE>
<LINE>Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,</LINE>
<LINE>As living here and you no use of him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speakest thou from thy heart?</LINE>

<LINE>Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!</LINE>
<LINE>Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Which she hath praised him with above compare</LINE>
<LINE>So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;</LINE>

<LINE>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</LINE>

<LINE>My father Capulet will have it so;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say you do not know the lady's mind:</LINE>
<LINE>Uneven is the course, I like it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore have I little talk'd of love;</LINE>
<LINE>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</LINE>
<LINE>That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the inundation of her tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</LINE>
<LINE>May be put from her by society:</LINE>
<LINE>Now do you know the reason of this haste.</LINE>

<LINE>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PARIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God shield I should disturb devotion!</LINE>
<LINE>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:</LINE>
<LINE>Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,</LINE>
<LINE>Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;</LINE>
<LINE>It strains me past the compass of my wits:</LINE>
<LINE>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</LINE>
<LINE>On Thursday next be married to this county.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:</LINE>
<LINE>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,</LINE>
<LINE>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</LINE>
<LINE>And with this knife I'll help it presently.</LINE>
<LINE>God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;</LINE>
<LINE>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be the label to another deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</LINE>
<LINE>Turn to another, this shall slay them both:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</LINE>
<LINE>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</LINE>
<LINE>Which the commission of thy years and art</LINE>
<LINE>Could to no issue of true honour bring.</LINE>
<LINE>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,</LINE>
<LINE>If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Which craves as desperate an execution.</LINE>
<LINE>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</LINE>
<LINE>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</LINE>
<LINE>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That copest with death himself to scape from it:</LINE>
<LINE>And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</LINE>
<LINE>From off the battlements of yonder tower;</LINE>
<LINE>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</LINE>
<LINE>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</LINE>
<LINE>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,</LINE>
<LINE>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,</LINE>
<LINE>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</LINE>
<LINE>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</LINE>
<LINE>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</LINE>
<LINE>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent</LINE>
<LINE>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;</LINE>
<LINE>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And this distilled liquor drink thou off;</LINE>
<LINE>When presently through all thy veins shall run</LINE>
<LINE>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</LINE>
<LINE>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</LINE>
<LINE>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</LINE>
<LINE>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</LINE>
<LINE>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</LINE>
<LINE>Each part, deprived of supple government,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:</LINE>
<LINE>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, as the manner of our country is,</LINE>
<LINE>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</LINE>
<LINE>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</LINE>
<LINE>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</LINE>
<LINE>And hither shall he come: and he and I</LINE>
<LINE>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</LINE>
<LINE>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</LINE>
<LINE>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Abate thy valour in the acting it.</LINE>

<LINE>Nurse! What should she do here?</LINE>
<LINE>My dismal scene I needs must act alone.</LINE>

<LINE>What if it be a poison, which the friar</LINE>
<LINE>Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he married me before to Romeo?</LINE>
<LINE>I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath still been tried a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>I wake before the time that Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,</LINE>
<LINE>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if I live, is it not very like,</LINE>
<LINE>The horrible conceit of death and night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the terror of the place,--</LINE>
<LINE>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, for these many hundred years, the bones</LINE>
<LINE>Of all my buried ancestors are packed:</LINE>
<LINE>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,</LINE>
<LINE>At some hours in the night spirits resort;--</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</LINE>
<LINE>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,</LINE>
<LINE>And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--</LINE>
<LINE>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</LINE>
<LINE>Environed with all these hideous fears?</LINE>
<LINE>And madly play with my forefather's joints?</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?</LINE>
<LINE>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,</LINE>
<LINE>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</LINE>
<LINE>O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!</LINE>

<LINE>Why 'Heart's ease?'</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My</LINE>

<LINE>O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:</LINE>
<LINE>My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;</LINE>
<LINE>And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--</LINE>
<LINE>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave</LINE>
<LINE>to think!--</LINE>
<LINE>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,</LINE>
<LINE>That I revived, and was an emperor.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,</LINE>
<LINE>When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BALTHASAR, booted</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</LINE>
<LINE>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</LINE>
<LINE>How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;</LINE>
<LINE>For nothing can be ill, if she be well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:</LINE>
<LINE>Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,</LINE>
<LINE>And her immortal part with angels lives.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,</LINE>
<LINE>And presently took post to tell it you:</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</LINE>
<LINE>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,</LINE>
<LINE>And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:</LINE>
<LINE>Your looks are pale and wild, and do import</LINE>
<LINE>Some misadventure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, thou art deceived:</LINE>
<LINE>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No matter: get thee gone,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.</LINE>
<LINE>Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift</LINE>
<LINE>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</LINE>
<LINE>I do remember an apothecary,--</LINE>
<LINE>And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted</LINE>
<LINE>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,</LINE>
<LINE>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</LINE>
<LINE>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</LINE>
<LINE>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins</LINE>
<LINE>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</LINE>
<LINE>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</LINE>
<LINE>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</LINE>
<LINE>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.</LINE>
<LINE>Noting this penury, to myself I said</LINE>
<LINE>'An if a man did need a poison now,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'</LINE>
<LINE>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</LINE>
<LINE>And this same needy man must sell it me.</LINE>
<LINE>As I remember, this should be the house.</LINE>
<LINE>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.</LINE>
<LINE>What, ho! apothecary!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Apothecary</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Apothecary</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who calls so loud?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have</LINE>
<LINE>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</LINE>
<LINE>As will disperse itself through all the veins</LINE>
<LINE>That the life-weary taker may fall dead</LINE>
<LINE>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</LINE>
<LINE>As violently as hasty powder fired</LINE>
<LINE>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Apothecary</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law</LINE>
<LINE>Is death to any he that utters them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,</LINE>
<LINE>And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;</LINE>
<LINE>The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;</LINE>
<LINE>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</LINE>
<LINE>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Apothecary</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Apothecary</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Put this in any liquid thing you will,</LINE>
<LINE>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength</LINE>
<LINE>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing more murders in this loathsome world,</LINE>
<LINE>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.</LINE>
<LINE>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me</LINE>

<LINE>One of our order, to associate me,</LINE>
<LINE>Here in this city visiting the sick,</LINE>
<LINE>And finding him, the searchers of the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Suspecting that we both were in a house</LINE>
<LINE>Where the infectious pestilence did reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;</LINE>
<LINE>So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR JOHN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could not send it,--here it is again,--</LINE>
<LINE>Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,</LINE>
<LINE>The letter was not nice but full of charge</LINE>

<LINE>May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight</LINE>
<LINE>Unto my cell.</LINE>

<LINE>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.</LINE>
<LINE>Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,</LINE>
<LINE>Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,</LINE>
<LINE>As signal that thou hear'st something approach.</LINE>

<LINE>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--</LINE>
<LINE>O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--</LINE>
<LINE>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:</LINE>
<LINE>The obsequies that I for thee will keep</LINE>
<LINE>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The Page whistles</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>And do not interrupt me in my course.</LINE>
<LINE>Why I descend into this bed of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Is partly to behold my lady's face;</LINE>
<LINE>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</LINE>
<LINE>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</LINE>
<LINE>In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:</LINE>
<LINE>But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry</LINE>
<LINE>In what I further shall intend to do,</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint</LINE>
<LINE>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:</LINE>
<LINE>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</LINE>
<LINE>More fierce and more inexorable far</LINE>
<LINE>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</LINE>

<LINE>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!</LINE>
<LINE>What said my man, when my betossed soul</LINE>
<LINE>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</LINE>
<LINE>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:</LINE>
<LINE>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?</LINE>
<LINE>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;</LINE>
<LINE>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,</LINE>
<LINE>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</LINE>
<LINE>This vault a feasting presence full of light.</LINE>
<LINE>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Laying PARIS in the tomb</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How oft when men are at the point of death</LINE>
<LINE>Have they been merry! which their keepers call</LINE>
<LINE>A lightning before death: O, how may I</LINE>
<LINE>Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet</LINE>
<LINE>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.</LINE>
<LINE>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</LINE>
<LINE>O, what more favour can I do to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</LINE>
<LINE>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</LINE>
<LINE>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe</LINE>
<LINE>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</LINE>
<LINE>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And never from this palace of dim night</LINE>
<LINE>Depart again: here, here will I remain</LINE>
<LINE>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here</LINE>
<LINE>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</LINE>
<LINE>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</LINE>
<LINE>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you</LINE>
<LINE>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</LINE>
<LINE>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</LINE>
<LINE>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</LINE>
<LINE>Here's to my love!</LINE>

<LINE>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:</LINE>
<LINE>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go, good Juliet,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Noise again</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I dare no longer stay.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit FRIAR LAURENCE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?</LINE>
<LINE>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:</LINE>
<LINE>O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop</LINE>
<LINE>To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;</LINE>
<LINE>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,</LINE>
<LINE>To make die with a restorative.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kisses him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thy lips are warm.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JULIET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Snatching ROMEO's dagger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This is thy sheath;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Stabs herself</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>there rust, and let me die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:</LINE>
<LINE>Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.</LINE>
<LINE>Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,</LINE>
<LINE>And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Who here hath lain these two days buried.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:</LINE>
<LINE>Raise up the Montagues: some others search:</LINE>
<LINE>We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;</LINE>
<LINE>But the true ground of all these piteous woes</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot without circumstance descry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:</LINE>
<LINE>We took this mattock and this spade from him,</LINE>
<LINE>As he was coming from this churchyard side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A great suspicion: stay the friar too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the PRINCE and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What misadventure is so early up,</LINE>
<LINE>That calls our person from our morning's rest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people in the street cry Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,</LINE>
<LINE>With open outcry toward our monument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What fear is this which startles in our ears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;</LINE>
<LINE>And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,</LINE>
<LINE>Warm and new kill'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Watchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;</LINE>
<LINE>With instruments upon them, fit to open</LINE>
<LINE>These dead men's tombs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!</LINE>
<LINE>This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house</LINE>
<LINE>Is empty on the back of Montague,--</LINE>
<LINE>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O me! this sight of death is as a bell,</LINE>
<LINE>That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MONTAGUE and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Montague; for thou art early up,</LINE>
<LINE>To see thy son and heir more early down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;</LINE>
<LINE>Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:</LINE>
<LINE>What further woe conspires against mine age?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, and thou shalt see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou untaught! what manners is in this?</LINE>
<LINE>To press before thy father to a grave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till we can clear these ambiguities,</LINE>
<LINE>And know their spring, their head, their</LINE>
<LINE>true descent;</LINE>
<LINE>And then will I be general of your woes,</LINE>
<LINE>And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,</LINE>
<LINE>And let mischance be slave to patience.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the greatest, able to do least,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make against me of this direful murder;</LINE>
<LINE>And here I stand, both to impeach and purge</LINE>
<LINE>Myself condemned and myself excused.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</LINE>
<LINE>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</LINE>
<LINE>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</LINE>
<LINE>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</LINE>
<LINE>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</LINE>
<LINE>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</LINE>
<LINE>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</LINE>
<LINE>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</LINE>
<LINE>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</LINE>
<LINE>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</LINE>
<LINE>To rid her from this second marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</LINE>
<LINE>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</LINE>
<LINE>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</LINE>
<LINE>As I intended, for it wrought on her</LINE>
<LINE>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should hither come as this dire night,</LINE>
<LINE>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</LINE>
<LINE>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</LINE>
<LINE>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</LINE>
<LINE>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</LINE>
<LINE>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</LINE>
<LINE>But when I came, some minute ere the time</LINE>
<LINE>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</LINE>
<LINE>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</LINE>
<LINE>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</LINE>
<LINE>All this I know; and to the marriage</LINE>
<LINE>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</LINE>
<LINE>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</LINE>
<LINE>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the rigour of severest law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We still have known thee for a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;</LINE>
<LINE>And then in post he came from Mantua</LINE>
<LINE>To this same place, to this same monument.</LINE>
<LINE>This letter he early bid me give his father,</LINE>
<LINE>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>I departed not and left him there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the letter; I will look on it.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>And by and by my master drew on him;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I ran away to call the watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</LINE>
<LINE>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</LINE>
<LINE>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</LINE>
<LINE>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</LINE>
<LINE>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</LINE>
<LINE>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</LINE>
<LINE>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</LINE>
<LINE>And I for winking at your discords too</LINE>
<LINE>Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</LINE>
<LINE>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more</LINE>
<LINE>Can I demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I can give thee more:</LINE>
<LINE>For I will raise her statue in pure gold;</LINE>
<LINE>That while Verona by that name is known,</LINE>
<LINE>There shall no figure at such rate be set</LINE>
<LINE>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;</LINE>
<LINE>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</LINE>
<LINE>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:</LINE>
<LINE>For never was a story of more woe</LINE>
<LINE>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</LINE>
<LINE>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</LINE>
<LINE>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</LINE>
<LINE>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</LINE>
<LINE>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</LINE>
<LINE>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</LINE>
<LINE>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</LINE>
<LINE>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</LINE>
<LINE>And furious close of civil butchery</LINE>
<LINE>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>March all one way and be no more opposed</LINE>
<LINE>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</LINE>
<LINE>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</LINE>
<LINE>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</LINE>
<LINE>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</LINE>
<LINE>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</LINE>
<LINE>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</LINE>
<LINE>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</LINE>
<LINE>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</LINE>
<LINE>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</LINE>
<LINE>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</LINE>
<LINE>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</LINE>
<LINE>What yesternight our council did decree</LINE>
<LINE>In forwarding this dear expedience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</LINE>
<LINE>And many limits of the charge set down</LINE>
<LINE>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</LINE>
<LINE>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand of his people butchered;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</LINE>
<LINE>Such beastly shameless transformation,</LINE>
<LINE>By those Welshwomen done as may not be</LINE>
<LINE>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</LINE>
<LINE>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For more uneven and unwelcome news</LINE>
<LINE>Came from the north and thus it did import:</LINE>
<LINE>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>At Holmedon met,</LINE>
<LINE>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</LINE>
<LINE>As by discharge of their artillery,</LINE>
<LINE>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</LINE>
<LINE>For he that brought them, in the very heat</LINE>
<LINE>And pride of their contention did take horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Uncertain of the issue any way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.</LINE>
<LINE>Stain'd with the variation of each soil</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</LINE>
<LINE>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</LINE>
<LINE>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</LINE>
<LINE>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son</LINE>
<LINE>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:</LINE>
<LINE>And is not this an honourable spoil?</LINE>
<LINE>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin</LINE>
<LINE>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</LINE>
<LINE>Should be the father to so blest a son,</LINE>
<LINE>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</LINE>
<LINE>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</LINE>
<LINE>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</LINE>
<LINE>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved</LINE>
<LINE>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</LINE>
<LINE>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</LINE>
<LINE>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</LINE>
<LINE>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</LINE>
<LINE>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</LINE>
<LINE>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</LINE>
<LINE>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,</LINE>
<LINE>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</LINE>
<LINE>The crest of youth against your dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have sent for him to answer this;</LINE>
<LINE>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</LINE>
<LINE>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</LINE>
<LINE>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</LINE>
<LINE>But come yourself with speed to us again;</LINE>
<LINE>For more is to be said and to be done</LINE>
<LINE>Than out of anger can be uttered.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack</LINE>
<LINE>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon</LINE>
<LINE>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to</LINE>
<LINE>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.</LINE>
<LINE>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the</LINE>
<LINE>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes</LINE>
<LINE>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the</LINE>
<LINE>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself</LINE>
<LINE>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no</LINE>
<LINE>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand</LINE>
<LINE>the time of the day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take</LINE>
<LINE>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not</LINE>
<LINE>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God</LINE>
<LINE>save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace</LINE>
<LINE>thou wilt have none,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, none?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</LINE>
<LINE>prologue to an egg and butter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not</LINE>
<LINE>us that are squires of the night's body be called</LINE>
<LINE>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's</LINE>
<LINE>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</LINE>
<LINE>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,</LINE>
<LINE>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and</LINE>
<LINE>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the</LINE>
<LINE>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and</LINE>
<LINE>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,</LINE>
<LINE>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</LINE>
<LINE>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</LINE>
<LINE>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with</LINE>
<LINE>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'</LINE>
<LINE>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</LINE>
<LINE>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my</LINE>
<LINE>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And</LINE>
<LINE>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and</LINE>
<LINE>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a</LINE>
<LINE>buff jerkin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a</LINE>
<LINE>time and oft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;</LINE>
<LINE>and where it would not, I have used my credit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent</LINE>
<LINE>that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet</LINE>
<LINE>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when</LINE>
<LINE>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is</LINE>
<LINE>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do</LINE>
<LINE>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; thou shalt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have</LINE>
<LINE>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my</LINE>
<LINE>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For obtaining of suits?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</LINE>
<LINE>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy</LINE>
<LINE>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of</LINE>
<LINE>Moor-ditch?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed</LINE>
<LINE>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young</LINE>
<LINE>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more</LINE>
<LINE>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</LINE>
<LINE>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old</LINE>
<LINE>lord of the council rated me the other day in the</LINE>
<LINE>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet</LINE>
<LINE>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and</LINE>
<LINE>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the</LINE>
<LINE>streets, and no man regards it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</LINE>
<LINE>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</LINE>
<LINE>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</LINE>
<LINE>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man</LINE>
<LINE>should speak truly, little better than one of the</LINE>
<LINE>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</LINE>
<LINE>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be damned for never a king's son in</LINE>
<LINE>Christendom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I</LINE>
<LINE>do not, call me villain and baffle me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying</LINE>
<LINE>to purse-taking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a</LINE>
<LINE>man to labour in his vocation.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POINS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a</LINE>
<LINE>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what</LINE>
<LINE>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the</LINE>
<LINE>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to</LINE>
<LINE>a true man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Ned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?</LINE>
<LINE>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how</LINE>
<LINE>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou</LINE>
<LINE>soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira</LINE>
<LINE>and a cold capon's leg?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have</LINE>
<LINE>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of</LINE>
<LINE>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four</LINE>
<LINE>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going</LINE>
<LINE>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders</LINE>
<LINE>riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards</LINE>
<LINE>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:</LINE>
<LINE>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke</LINE>
<LINE>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it</LINE>
<LINE>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff</LINE>
<LINE>your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry</LINE>
<LINE>at home and be hanged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll hang you for going.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will, chops?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hal, wilt thou make one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good</LINE>
<LINE>fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood</LINE>
<LINE>royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's well said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I care not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:</LINE>
<LINE>I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure</LINE>
<LINE>that he shall go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him</LINE>
<LINE>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may</LINE>
<LINE>move and what he hears may be believed, that the</LINE>
<LINE>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false</LINE>
<LINE>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want</LINE>
<LINE>countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Falstaff</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot</LINE>
<LINE>manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill</LINE>
<LINE>shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:</LINE>
<LINE>yourself and I will not be there; and when they</LINE>
<LINE>have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut</LINE>
<LINE>this head off from my shoulders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How shall we part with them in setting forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and</LINE>
<LINE>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at</LINE>
<LINE>our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure</LINE>
<LINE>upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have</LINE>
<LINE>no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our</LINE>
<LINE>horses, by our habits and by every other</LINE>
<LINE>appointment, to be ourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them</LINE>
<LINE>in the wood; our vizards we will change after we</LINE>
<LINE>leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram</LINE>
<LINE>for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as</LINE>
<LINE>true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the</LINE>
<LINE>third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll</LINE>
<LINE>forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the</LINE>
<LINE>incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will</LINE>
<LINE>tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at</LINE>
<LINE>least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what</LINE>
<LINE>extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this</LINE>
<LINE>lies the jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things</LINE>
<LINE>necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;</LINE>
<LINE>there I'll sup. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Poins</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you all, and will awhile uphold</LINE>
<LINE>The unyoked humour of your idleness:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</LINE>
<LINE>To smother up his beauty from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when he please again to be himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</LINE>
<LINE>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.</LINE>
<LINE>If all the year were playing holidays,</LINE>
<LINE>To sport would be as tedious as to work;</LINE>
<LINE>But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</LINE>
<LINE>So, when this loose behavior I throw off</LINE>
<LINE>And pay the debt I never promised,</LINE>
<LINE>By how much better than my word I am,</LINE>
<LINE>By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;</LINE>
<LINE>And like bright metal on a sullen ground,</LINE>
<LINE>My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;</LINE>
<LINE>Redeeming time when men think least I will.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My blood hath been too cold and temperate,</LINE>
<LINE>Unapt to stir at these indignities,</LINE>
<LINE>And you have found me; for accordingly</LINE>
<LINE>You tread upon my patience: but be sure</LINE>
<LINE>I will from henceforth rather be myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;</LINE>
<LINE>Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore lost that title of respect</LINE>
<LINE>Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves</LINE>
<LINE>The scourge of greatness to be used on it;</LINE>
<LINE>And that same greatness too which our own hands</LINE>
<LINE>Have holp to make so portly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord.--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see</LINE>
<LINE>Danger and disobedience in thine eye:</LINE>
<LINE>O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,</LINE>
<LINE>And majesty might never yet endure</LINE>
<LINE>The moody frontier of a servant brow.</LINE>
<LINE>You have good leave to leave us: when we need</LINE>
<LINE>Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Worcester</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You were about to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>To North</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my good lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</LINE>
<LINE>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</LINE>
<LINE>As is deliver'd to your majesty:</LINE>
<LINE>Either envy, therefore, or misprison</LINE>
<LINE>Is guilty of this fault and not my son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>But I remember, when the fight was done,</LINE>
<LINE>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd</LINE>
<LINE>Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;</LINE>
<LINE>He was perfumed like a milliner;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</LINE>
<LINE>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</LINE>
<LINE>He gave his nose and took't away again;</LINE>
<LINE>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</LINE>
<LINE>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</LINE>
<LINE>He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</LINE>
<LINE>With many holiday and lady terms</LINE>
<LINE>He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded</LINE>
<LINE>My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.</LINE>
<LINE>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</LINE>
<LINE>To be so pester'd with a popinjay,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my grief and my impatience,</LINE>
<LINE>Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,</LINE>
<LINE>He should or he should not; for he made me mad</LINE>
<LINE>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</LINE>
<LINE>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</LINE>
<LINE>Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--</LINE>
<LINE>And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth</LINE>
<LINE>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;</LINE>
<LINE>And that it was great pity, so it was,</LINE>
<LINE>This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd</LINE>
<LINE>So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,</LINE>
<LINE>He would himself have been a soldier.</LINE>
<LINE>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I answer'd indirectly, as I said;</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you, let not his report</LINE>
<LINE>Come current for an accusation</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said</LINE>
<LINE>To such a person and in such a place,</LINE>
<LINE>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</LINE>
<LINE>May reasonably die and never rise</LINE>
<LINE>To do him wrong or any way impeach</LINE>
<LINE>What then he said, so he unsay it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</LINE>
<LINE>But with proviso and exception,</LINE>
<LINE>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</LINE>
<LINE>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd</LINE>
<LINE>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,</LINE>
<LINE>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,</LINE>
<LINE>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</LINE>
<LINE>No, on the barren mountains let him starve;</LINE>
<LINE>For I shall never hold that man my friend</LINE>
<LINE>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</LINE>
<LINE>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revolted Mortimer!</LINE>
<LINE>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</LINE>
<LINE>But by the chance of war; to prove that true</LINE>
<LINE>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took</LINE>
<LINE>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,</LINE>
<LINE>In single opposition, hand to hand,</LINE>
<LINE>He did confound the best part of an hour</LINE>
<LINE>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>Three times they breathed and three times did</LINE>
<LINE>they drink,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;</LINE>
<LINE>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</LINE>
<LINE>Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.</LINE>
<LINE>Never did base and rotten policy</LINE>
<LINE>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor could the noble Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>Receive so many, and all willingly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</LINE>
<LINE>He never did encounter with Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee,</LINE>
<LINE>He durst as well have met the devil alone</LINE>
<LINE>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:</LINE>
<LINE>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</LINE>
<LINE>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me</LINE>
<LINE>As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>We licence your departure with your son.</LINE>
<LINE>Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if the devil come and roar for them,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not send them: I will after straight</LINE>
<LINE>And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit I make a hazard of my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes your uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter WORCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak of Mortimer!</LINE>
<LINE>'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Want mercy, if I do not join with him:</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,</LINE>
<LINE>And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>As high in the air as this unthankful king,</LINE>
<LINE>As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who struck this heat up after I was gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;</LINE>
<LINE>And when I urged the ransom once again</LINE>
<LINE>Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,</LINE>
<LINE>And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd</LINE>
<LINE>By Richard that dead is the next of blood?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was; I heard the proclamation:</LINE>
<LINE>And then it was when the unhappy king,</LINE>
<LINE>--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his Irish expedition;</LINE>
<LINE>From whence he intercepted did return</LINE>
<LINE>To be deposed and shortly murdered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>Heir to the crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did; myself did hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,</LINE>
<LINE>That wished him on the barren mountains starve.</LINE>
<LINE>But shall it be that you, that set the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the head of this forgetful man</LINE>
<LINE>And for his sake wear the detested blot</LINE>
<LINE>Of murderous subornation, shall it be,</LINE>
<LINE>That you a world of curses undergo,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the agents, or base second means,</LINE>
<LINE>The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon me that I descend so low,</LINE>
<LINE>To show the line and the predicament</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you range under this subtle king;</LINE>
<LINE>Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,</LINE>
<LINE>Or fill up chronicles in time to come,</LINE>
<LINE>That men of your nobility and power</LINE>
<LINE>Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,</LINE>
<LINE>As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,</LINE>
<LINE>To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,</LINE>
<LINE>An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall it in more shame be further spoken,</LINE>
<LINE>That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off</LINE>
<LINE>By him for whom these shames ye underwent?</LINE>
<LINE>No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem</LINE>
<LINE>Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves</LINE>
<LINE>Into the good thoughts of the world again,</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt</LINE>
<LINE>Of this proud king, who studies day and night</LINE>
<LINE>To answer all the debt he owes to you</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, I say--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, cousin, say no more:</LINE>
<LINE>And now I will unclasp a secret book,</LINE>
<LINE>And to your quick-conceiving discontents</LINE>
<LINE>I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</LINE>
<LINE>As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud</LINE>
<LINE>On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that</LINE>
<LINE>I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the</LINE>
<LINE>wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with</LINE>
<LINE>him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his</LINE>
<LINE>company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one</LINE>
<LINE>that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.</LINE>
<LINE>They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;</LINE>
<LINE>they will away presently.</LINE>

<LINE>No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no</LINE>
<LINE>starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou</LINE>
<LINE>dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are</LINE>
<LINE>content to do the profession some grace; that would,</LINE>
<LINE>if matters should be looked into, for their own</LINE>
<LINE>credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no</LINE>
<LINE>foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,</LINE>
<LINE>none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;</LINE>
<LINE>but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and</LINE>
<LINE>great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will</LINE>
<LINE>strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than</LINE>
<LINE>drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,</LINE>
<LINE>I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the</LINE>
<LINE>commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey</LINE>
<LINE>on her, for they ride up and down on her and make</LINE>
<LINE>her their boots.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to</LINE>

<LINE>would be argument for a week, laughter for a month</LINE>
<LINE>and a good jest for ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand close; I hear them coming.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Thieves again</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse</LINE>
<LINE>before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two</LINE>
<LINE>arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's</LINE>
<LINE>no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Your money!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villains!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon
them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow
or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:</LINE>
<LINE>The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear</LINE>
<LINE>So strongly that they dare not meet each other;</LINE>
<LINE>Each takes his fellow for an officer.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,</LINE>
<LINE>And lards the lean earth as he walks along:</LINE>
<LINE>Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How the rogue roar'd!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well</LINE>
<LINE>contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear</LINE>
<LINE>your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,</LINE>
<LINE>then? In respect of the love he bears our house:</LINE>
<LINE>he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than</LINE>
<LINE>he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The</LINE>
<LINE>purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's</LINE>
<LINE>certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to</LINE>
<LINE>drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this</LINE>
<LINE>nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The</LINE>
<LINE>purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you</LINE>
<LINE>have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and</LINE>
<LINE>your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so</LINE>
<LINE>great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say</LINE>
<LINE>unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and</LINE>
<LINE>you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our</LINE>
<LINE>friends true and constant: a good plot, good</LINE>
<LINE>friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,</LINE>
<LINE>very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is</LINE>
<LINE>this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the</LINE>
<LINE>general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by</LINE>
<LINE>this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.</LINE>
<LINE>Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord</LINE>
<LINE>Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?</LINE>
<LINE>is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all</LINE>
<LINE>their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the</LINE>
<LINE>next month? and are they not some of them set</LINE>
<LINE>forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an</LINE>
<LINE>infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity</LINE>
<LINE>of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay</LINE>
<LINE>open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself</LINE>
<LINE>and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of</LINE>
<LINE>skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!</LINE>
<LINE>let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set</LINE>
<LINE>forward to-night.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?</LINE>
<LINE>For what offence have I this fortnight been</LINE>
<LINE>A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee</LINE>
<LINE>Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>And start so often when thou sit'st alone?</LINE>
<LINE>Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;</LINE>
<LINE>And given my treasures and my rights of thee</LINE>
<LINE>To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?</LINE>
<LINE>In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;</LINE>
<LINE>Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;</LINE>
<LINE>Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,</LINE>
<LINE>Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,</LINE>
<LINE>Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,</LINE>
<LINE>Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the currents of a heady fight.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war</LINE>
<LINE>And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow</LINE>
<LINE>Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as we see when men restrain their breath</LINE>
<LINE>On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?</LINE>
<LINE>Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And I must know it, else he loves me not.</LINE>

<LINE>A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen</LINE>

<LINE>I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.</LINE>
<LINE>I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir</LINE>
<LINE>About his title, and hath sent for you</LINE>
<LINE>To line his enterprise: but if you go,--</LINE>

<LINE>Come, come, you paraquito, answer me</LINE>

<LINE>An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away,</LINE>
<LINE>Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,</LINE>
<LINE>I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world</LINE>
<LINE>To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:</LINE>
<LINE>We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!</LINE>

<LINE>have with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, do not then; for since you love me not,</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Come, wilt thou see me ride?</LINE>

<LINE>I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;</LINE>
<LINE>I must not have you henceforth question me</LINE>
<LINE>Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:</LINE>
<LINE>Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,</LINE>
<LINE>This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.</LINE>
<LINE>I know you wise, but yet no farther wise</LINE>
<LINE>Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet a woman: and for secrecy,</LINE>
<LINE>No lady closer; for I well believe</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;</LINE>
<LINE>And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! so far?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:</LINE>
<LINE>Whither I go, thither shall you go too;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me</LINE>
<LINE>thy hand to laugh a little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where hast been, Hal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four</LINE>
<LINE>score hogsheads. I have sounded the very</LINE>
<LINE>base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother</LINE>
<LINE>to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by</LINE>
<LINE>their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.</LINE>
<LINE>They take it already upon their salvation, that</LINE>
<LINE>though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king</LINE>
<LINE>of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,</LINE>
<LINE>like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a</LINE>
<LINE>good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I</LINE>
<LINE>am king of England, I shall command all the good</LINE>
<LINE>lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing</LINE>
<LINE>scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they</LINE>
<LINE>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I</LINE>
<LINE>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language</LINE>
<LINE>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost</LINE>
<LINE>much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet</LINE>
<LINE>action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of</LINE>
<LINE>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped</LINE>
<LINE>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that</LINE>
<LINE>never spake other English in his life than 'Eight</LINE>
<LINE>shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with</LINE>
<LINE>this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint</LINE>
<LINE>of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to</LINE>
<LINE>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my</LINE>
<LINE>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do</LINE>
<LINE>thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale</LINE>
<LINE>to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and</LINE>
<LINE>I'll show thee a precedent.</LINE>

<LINE>die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be</LINE>
<LINE>not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a</LINE>
<LINE>shotten herring. There live not three good men</LINE>

<LINE>grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.</LINE>
<LINE>I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any</LINE>

<LINE>through and through; my sword hacked like a</LINE>
<LINE>hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since</LINE>
<LINE>I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all</LINE>
<LINE>cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or</LINE>
<LINE>less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, sirs; how was it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We four set upon some dozen--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sixteen at least, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And bound them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, they were not bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I</LINE>
<LINE>am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, fought you with them all?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought</LINE>
<LINE>not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if</LINE>
<LINE>there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old</LINE>
<LINE>Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray God you have not murdered some of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two</LINE>
<LINE>of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues</LINE>
<LINE>in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell</LINE>
<LINE>thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou</LINE>
<LINE>knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my</LINE>
<LINE>point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, four? thou saidst but two even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Four, Hal; I told thee four.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, he said four.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at</LINE>
<LINE>me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven</LINE>
<LINE>points in my target, thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seven? why, there were but four even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In buckram?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, four, in buckram suits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear me, Hal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine</LINE>
<LINE>in buckram that I told thee of--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, two more already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Their points being broken,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Down fell their hose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,</LINE>
<LINE>came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of</LINE>
<LINE>the eleven I paid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten</LINE>
<LINE>knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive</LINE>
<LINE>at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst</LINE>
<LINE>not see thy hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These lies are like their father that begets them;</LINE>
<LINE>gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou</LINE>
<LINE>clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou</LINE>
<LINE>whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth</LINE>
<LINE>the truth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal</LINE>
<LINE>green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy</LINE>
<LINE>hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the</LINE>
<LINE>strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would</LINE>
<LINE>not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on</LINE>
<LINE>compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as</LINE>
<LINE>blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon</LINE>
<LINE>compulsion, I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine</LINE>
<LINE>coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,</LINE>
<LINE>this huge hill of flesh,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried</LINE>
<LINE>neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O</LINE>
<LINE>for breath to utter what is like thee! you</LINE>
<LINE>tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile</LINE>
<LINE>standing-tuck,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and</LINE>
<LINE>when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,</LINE>
<LINE>hear me speak but this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark, Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and</LINE>
<LINE>were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain</LINE>
<LINE>tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you</LINE>
<LINE>four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your</LINE>
<LINE>prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in</LINE>
<LINE>the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts</LINE>
<LINE>away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared</LINE>
<LINE>for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard</LINE>
<LINE>bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword</LINE>
<LINE>as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!</LINE>
<LINE>What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst</LINE>
<LINE>thou now find out to hide thee from this open and</LINE>
<LINE>apparent shame?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the</LINE>
<LINE>heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?</LINE>
<LINE>why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but</LINE>
<LINE>beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true</LINE>
<LINE>prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a</LINE>
<LINE>coward on instinct. I shall think the better of</LINE>
<LINE>myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant</LINE>
<LINE>lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap</LINE>
<LINE>to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles</LINE>
<LINE>of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be</LINE>
<LINE>merry? shall we have a play extempore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hostess</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, my lord the prince!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to</LINE>
<LINE>me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at</LINE>
<LINE>door would speak with you: he says he comes from</LINE>
<LINE>your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and</LINE>
<LINE>send him back again to my mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner of man is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An old man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall</LINE>
<LINE>I give him his answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, do, Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, and I'll send him packing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit FALSTAFF</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,</LINE>
<LINE>Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you</LINE>
<LINE>ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true</LINE>
<LINE>prince; no, fie!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's</LINE>
<LINE>sword so hacked?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would</LINE>
<LINE>swear truth out of England but he would make you</LINE>
<LINE>believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to</LINE>
<LINE>make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments</LINE>
<LINE>with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I</LINE>
<LINE>did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed</LINE>
<LINE>to hear his monstrous devices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years</LINE>
<LINE>ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since</LINE>
<LINE>thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and</LINE>
<LINE>sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what</LINE>
<LINE>instinct hadst thou for it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold</LINE>
<LINE>these exhalations?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think you they portend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hot livers and cold purses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, if rightly taken, halter.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter FALSTAFF</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.</LINE>
<LINE>How now, my sweet creature of bombast!</LINE>
<LINE>How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was</LINE>
<LINE>not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have</LINE>
<LINE>crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of</LINE>
<LINE>sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a</LINE>
<LINE>bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the</LINE>
<LINE>court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the</LINE>
<LINE>north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the</LINE>
<LINE>bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the</LINE>
<LINE>devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh</LINE>
<LINE>hook--what a plague call you him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Glendower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of</LINE>
<LINE>Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill</LINE>
<LINE>perpendicular,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that rides at high speed and with his pistol</LINE>
<LINE>kills a sparrow flying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have hit it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did he never the sparrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so</LINE>
<LINE>for running!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,</LINE>
<LINE>and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:</LINE>
<LINE>Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's</LINE>
<LINE>beard is turned white with the news: you may buy</LINE>
<LINE>land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and</LINE>
<LINE>this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads</LINE>
<LINE>as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we</LINE>
<LINE>shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,</LINE>
<LINE>art not thou horrible afeard? thou being</LINE>
<LINE>heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three</LINE>
<LINE>such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that</LINE>
<LINE>spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou</LINE>
<LINE>not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at</LINE>
<LINE>it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou</LINE>
<LINE>comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the</LINE>
<LINE>particulars of my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,</LINE>
<LINE>this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden</LINE>
<LINE>sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich</LINE>
<LINE>crown for a pitiful bald crown!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to</LINE>
<LINE>make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have</LINE>
<LINE>wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it</LINE>
<LINE>in King Cambyses' vein.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, here is my leg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, the father, how he holds his countenance!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;</LINE>
<LINE>For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry</LINE>
<LINE>players as ever I see!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.</LINE>
<LINE>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy</LINE>
<LINE>time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though</LINE>
<LINE>the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster</LINE>
<LINE>it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the</LINE>
<LINE>sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have</LINE>
<LINE>partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a</LINE>
<LINE>foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant</LINE>
<LINE>me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;</LINE>
<LINE>why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</LINE>
<LINE>the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat</LINE>
<LINE>blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall</LINE>
<LINE>the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a</LINE>
<LINE>question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>which thou hast often heard of and it is known to</LINE>
<LINE>many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth</LINE>
<LINE>the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not</LINE>
<LINE>speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in</LINE>
<LINE>pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in</LINE>
<LINE>woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I</LINE>
<LINE>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a</LINE>
<LINE>cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble</LINE>
<LINE>carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,</LINE>
<LINE>by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I</LINE>
<LINE>remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man</LINE>
<LINE>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</LINE>
<LINE>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,</LINE>
<LINE>peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell</LINE>
<LINE>me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast</LINE>
<LINE>thou been this month?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,</LINE>
<LINE>and I'll play my father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so</LINE>
<LINE>majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by</LINE>
<LINE>the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, here I am set.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here I stand: judge, my masters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Harry, whence come you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle</LINE>
<LINE>ye for a young prince, i' faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look</LINE>
<LINE>on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:</LINE>
<LINE>there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an</LINE>
<LINE>old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why</LINE>
<LINE>dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that</LINE>
<LINE>bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel</LINE>
<LINE>of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed</LINE>
<LINE>cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with</LINE>
<LINE>the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that</LINE>
<LINE>grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in</LINE>
<LINE>years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and</LINE>
<LINE>drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a</LINE>
<LINE>capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?</LINE>
<LINE>wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,</LINE>
<LINE>but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your grace would take me with you: whom</LINE>
<LINE>means your grace?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That villanous abominable misleader of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the man I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thou dost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,</LINE>
<LINE>were to say more than I know. That he is old, the</LINE>
<LINE>more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but</LINE>
<LINE>that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,</LINE>
<LINE>that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,</LINE>
<LINE>God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a</LINE>
<LINE>sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if</LINE>
<LINE>to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine</LINE>
<LINE>are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,</LINE>
<LINE>banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,</LINE>
<LINE>valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him</LINE>
<LINE>thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's</LINE>
<LINE>company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do, I will.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A knocking heard</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BARDOLPH, running</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous watch is at the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to</LINE>
<LINE>say in the behalf of that Falstaff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter the Hostess</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, my lord, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:</LINE>
<LINE>what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they</LINE>
<LINE>are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of</LINE>
<LINE>gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,</LINE>
<LINE>without seeming so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou a natural coward, without instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,</LINE>
<LINE>so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart</LINE>
<LINE>as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!</LINE>
<LINE>I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up</LINE>
<LINE>above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good</LINE>
<LINE>conscience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both which I have had: but their date is out, and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore I'll hide me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call in the sheriff.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Sheriff and the Carrier</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry</LINE>
<LINE>Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One of them is well known, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>A gross fat man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Carrier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As fat as butter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The man, I do assure you, is not here;</LINE>
<LINE>For I myself at this time have employ'd him.</LINE>
<LINE>And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee</LINE>
<LINE>That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,</LINE>
<LINE>Send him to answer thee, or any man,</LINE>
<LINE>For any thing he shall be charged withal:</LINE>
<LINE>And so let me entreat you leave the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall be answerable; and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good night, my noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it is good morrow, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,</LINE>
<LINE>call him forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and</LINE>
<LINE>snorting like a horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What hast thou found?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but papers, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's see what they be: read them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.</LINE>
<LINE>Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.</LINE>
<LINE>Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.</LINE>
<LINE>Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.</LINE>
<LINE>Item, Bread,        ob.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to</LINE>
<LINE>this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,</LINE>
<LINE>keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there</LINE>
<LINE>let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the</LINE>
<LINE>morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place</LINE>
<LINE>shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a</LINE>
<LINE>charge of foot; and I know his death will be a</LINE>
<LINE>march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid</LINE>
<LINE>back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in</LINE>
<LINE>the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, good my lord.</LINE>

<ACT><TITLE>ACT III</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</LINE>
<LINE>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you sit down?</LINE>
<LINE>And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot the map.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, here it is.</LINE>
<LINE>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,</LINE>
<LINE>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</LINE>
<LINE>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with</LINE>
<LINE>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot blame him: at my nativity</LINE>
<LINE>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>Of burning cressets; and at my birth</LINE>
<LINE>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Shaked like a coward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if</LINE>
<LINE>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself</LINE>
<LINE>had never been born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say the earth did shake when I was born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And not in fear of your nativity.</LINE>
<LINE>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</LINE>
<LINE>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</LINE>
<LINE>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd</LINE>
<LINE>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</LINE>
<LINE>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</LINE>
<LINE>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</LINE>
<LINE>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,</LINE>
<LINE>In passion shook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, of many men</LINE>
<LINE>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>To tell you once again that at my birth</LINE>
<LINE>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</LINE>
<LINE>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</LINE>
<LINE>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the courses of my life do show</LINE>
<LINE>I am not in the roll of common men.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</LINE>
<LINE>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</LINE>
<LINE>And bring him out that is but woman's son</LINE>
<LINE>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</LINE>
<LINE>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so can I, or so can any man;</LINE>
<LINE>But will they come when you do call for them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</LINE>
<LINE>The devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</LINE>
<LINE>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</LINE>
<LINE>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</LINE>
<LINE>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</LINE>
<LINE>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</LINE>
<LINE>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</LINE>
<LINE>How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right</LINE>
<LINE>According to our threefold order ta'en?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The archdeacon hath divided it</LINE>
<LINE>Into three limits very equally:</LINE>
<LINE>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</LINE>
<LINE>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</LINE>
<LINE>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the fertile land within that bound,</LINE>
<LINE>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</LINE>
<LINE>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</LINE>
<LINE>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</LINE>
<LINE>Which being sealed interchangeably,</LINE>
<LINE>A business that this night may execute,</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</LINE>
<LINE>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</LINE>
<LINE>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</LINE>
<LINE>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</LINE>
<LINE>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</LINE>
<LINE>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</LINE>
<LINE>Within that space you may have drawn together</LINE>
<LINE>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:</LINE>
<LINE>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</LINE>
<LINE>For there will be a world of water shed</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</LINE>
<LINE>In quantity equals not one of yours:</LINE>
<LINE>See how this river comes me cranking in,</LINE>
<LINE>And cuts me from the best of all my land</LINE>
<LINE>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</LINE>
<LINE>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</LINE>
<LINE>In a new channel, fair and evenly;</LINE>
<LINE>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</LINE>
<LINE>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but</LINE>
<LINE>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</LINE>
<LINE>With like advantage on the other side;</LINE>
<LINE>Gelding the opposed continent as much</LINE>
<LINE>As on the other side it takes from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</LINE>
<LINE>And on this north side win this cape of land;</LINE>
<LINE>And then he runs straight and even.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll not have it alter'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will not you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor you shall not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who shall say me nay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that will I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;</LINE>
<LINE>For I was train'd up in the English court;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, being but young, I framed to the harp</LINE>
<LINE>Many an English ditty lovely well</LINE>
<LINE>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</LINE>
<LINE>A virtue that was never seen in you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am glad of it with all my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</LINE>
<LINE>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;</LINE>
<LINE>And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so much as mincing poetry:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land</LINE>
<LINE>To any well-deserving friend;</LINE>
<LINE>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</LINE>
<LINE>Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll haste the writer and withal</LINE>
<LINE>Break with your wives of your departure hence:</LINE>
<LINE>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</LINE>
<LINE>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit GLENDOWER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot choose: sometime he angers me</LINE>
<LINE>With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,</LINE>
<LINE>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</LINE>
<LINE>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</LINE>
<LINE>A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,</LINE>
<LINE>A couching lion and a ramping cat,</LINE>
<LINE>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</LINE>
<LINE>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;</LINE>
<LINE>He held me last night at least nine hours</LINE>
<LINE>In reckoning up the several devils' names</LINE>
<LINE>That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'</LINE>
<LINE>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious</LINE>
<LINE>As a tired horse, a railing wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live</LINE>
<LINE>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</LINE>
<LINE>Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</LINE>
<LINE>In any summer-house in Christendom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Exceedingly well read, and profited</LINE>
<LINE>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion</LINE>
<LINE>And as wondrous affable and as bountiful</LINE>
<LINE>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</LINE>
<LINE>He holds your temper in a high respect</LINE>
<LINE>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</LINE>
<LINE>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant you, that man is not alive</LINE>
<LINE>Might so have tempted him as you have done,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the taste of danger and reproof:</LINE>
<LINE>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;</LINE>
<LINE>And since your coming hither have done enough</LINE>
<LINE>To put him quite beside his patience.</LINE>
<LINE>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:</LINE>
<LINE>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--</LINE>
<LINE>And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Defect of manners, want of government,</LINE>
<LINE>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:</LINE>
<LINE>The least of which haunting a nobleman</LINE>
<LINE>Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</LINE>
<LINE>Beguiling them of commendation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!</LINE>
<LINE>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the deadly spite that angers me;</LINE>
<LINE>My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;</LINE>
<LINE>She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy</LINE>
<LINE>Shall follow in your conduct speedily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she
answers him in the same</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,</LINE>
<LINE>one that no persuasion can do good upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks in Welsh</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens</LINE>
<LINE>I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,</LINE>
<LINE>In such a parley should I answer thee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks again in Welsh</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I understand thy kisses and thou mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And that's a feeling disputation:</LINE>
<LINE>But I will never be a truant, love,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,</LINE>
<LINE>With ravishing division, to her lute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks again in Welsh</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I am ignorance itself in this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down</LINE>
<LINE>And rest your gentle head upon her lap,</LINE>
<LINE>And she will sing the song that pleaseth you</LINE>
<LINE>And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,</LINE>
<LINE>Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep</LINE>
<LINE>As is the difference betwixt day and night</LINE>
<LINE>The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team</LINE>
<LINE>Begins his golden progress in the east.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:</LINE>
<LINE>By that time will our book, I think, be drawn</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so;</LINE>
<LINE>And those musicians that shall play to you</LINE>
<LINE>Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,</LINE>
<LINE>quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, ye giddy goose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The music plays</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.</LINE>
<LINE>By'r lady, he is a good musician.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then should you be nothing but musical for you are</LINE>
<LINE>altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,</LINE>
<LINE>and hear the lady sing in Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</LINE>
<LINE>Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>For we shall presently have need of you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know not whether God will have it so,</LINE>
<LINE>For some displeasing service I have done,</LINE>
<LINE>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood</LINE>
<LINE>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou dost in thy passages of life</LINE>
<LINE>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd</LINE>
<LINE>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</LINE>
<LINE>Could such inordinate and low desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</LINE>
<LINE>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,</LINE>
<LINE>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</LINE>
<LINE>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your majesty, I would I could</LINE>
<LINE>Quit all offences with as clear excuse</LINE>
<LINE>As well as I am doubtless I can purge</LINE>
<LINE>Myself of many I am charged withal:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</LINE>
<LINE>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</LINE>
<LINE>which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</LINE>
<LINE>By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,</LINE>
<LINE>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth</LINE>
<LINE>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,</LINE>
<LINE>Find pardon on my true submission.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</LINE>
<LINE>And art almost an alien to the hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</LINE>
<LINE>The hope and expectation of thy time</LINE>
<LINE>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</LINE>
<LINE>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</LINE>
<LINE>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</LINE>
<LINE>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</LINE>
<LINE>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Had still kept loyal to possession</LINE>
<LINE>And left me in reputeless banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</LINE>
<LINE>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</LINE>
<LINE>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</LINE>
<LINE>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</LINE>
<LINE>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</LINE>
<LINE>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And dress'd myself in such humility</LINE>
<LINE>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</LINE>
<LINE>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</LINE>
<LINE>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</LINE>
<LINE>And won by rareness such solemnity.</LINE>
<LINE>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</LINE>
<LINE>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</LINE>
<LINE>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</LINE>
<LINE>And gave his countenance, against his name,</LINE>
<LINE>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</LINE>
<LINE>Of every beardless vain comparative,</LINE>
<LINE>Grew a companion to the common streets,</LINE>
<LINE>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</LINE>
<LINE>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>They surfeited with honey and began</LINE>
<LINE>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</LINE>
<LINE>More than a little is by much too much.</LINE>
<LINE>So when he had occasion to be seen,</LINE>
<LINE>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</LINE>
<LINE>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</LINE>
<LINE>As, sick and blunted with community,</LINE>
<LINE>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</LINE>
<LINE>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</LINE>
<LINE>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</LINE>
<LINE>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</LINE>
<LINE>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</LINE>
<LINE>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</LINE>
<LINE>With vile participation: not an eye</LINE>
<LINE>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</LINE>
<LINE>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</LINE>
<LINE>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Be more myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For all the world</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art to this hour was Richard then</LINE>
<LINE>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</LINE>
<LINE>And even as I was then is Percy now.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath more worthy interest to the state</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou the shadow of succession;</LINE>
<LINE>For of no right, nor colour like to right,</LINE>
<LINE>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</LINE>
<LINE>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</LINE>
<LINE>What never-dying honour hath he got</LINE>
<LINE>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms</LINE>
<LINE>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</LINE>
<LINE>And military title capital</LINE>
<LINE>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</LINE>
<LINE>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</LINE>
<LINE>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</LINE>
<LINE>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</LINE>
<LINE>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</LINE>
<LINE>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</LINE>
<LINE>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Capitulate against us and are up.</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Base inclination and the start of spleen</LINE>
<LINE>To fight against me under Percy's pay,</LINE>
<LINE>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>To show how much thou art degenerate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:</LINE>
<LINE>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd</LINE>
<LINE>Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!</LINE>
<LINE>I will redeem all this on Percy's head</LINE>
<LINE>And in the closing of some glorious day</LINE>
<LINE>Be bold to tell you that I am your son;</LINE>
<LINE>When I will wear a garment all of blood</LINE>
<LINE>And stain my favours in a bloody mask,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,</LINE>
<LINE>That this same child of honour and renown,</LINE>
<LINE>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,</LINE>
<LINE>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.</LINE>
<LINE>For every honour sitting on his helm,</LINE>
<LINE>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</LINE>
<LINE>My shames redoubled! for the time will come,</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</LINE>
<LINE>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</LINE>
<LINE>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will call him to so strict account,</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall render every glory up,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</LINE>
<LINE>This, in the name of God, I promise here:</LINE>
<LINE>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech your majesty may salve</LINE>
<LINE>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:</LINE>
<LINE>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</LINE>
<LINE>Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</LINE>

<LINE>How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So hath the business that I come to speak of.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word</LINE>
<LINE>That Douglas and the English rebels met</LINE>
<LINE>The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury</LINE>
<LINE>A mighty and a fearful head they are,</LINE>
<LINE>If promises be kept on every hand,</LINE>
<LINE>As ever offer'd foul play in the state.</LINE>

<LINE>On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;</LINE>
<LINE>On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting</LINE>
<LINE>Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march</LINE>
<LINE>Through Gloucestershire; by which account,</LINE>
<LINE>Our business valued, some twelve days hence</LINE>
<LINE>Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last</LINE>
<LINE>action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my</LINE>
<LINE>skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose</LINE>
<LINE>gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some</LINE>
<LINE>liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I</LINE>
<LINE>shall have no strength to repent. An I have not</LINE>
<LINE>forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I</LINE>
<LINE>am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a</LINE>
<LINE>church! Company, villanous company, hath been the</LINE>
<LINE>spoil of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make</LINE>
<LINE>me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not</LINE>
<LINE>above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once</LINE>
<LINE>in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I</LINE>
<LINE>borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in</LINE>
<LINE>good compass: and now I live out of all order, out</LINE>
<LINE>of all compass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs</LINE>
<LINE>be out of all compass, out of all reasonable</LINE>
<LINE>compass, Sir John.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:</LINE>
<LINE>thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in</LINE>
<LINE>the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the</LINE>
<LINE>Knight of the Burning Lamp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many</LINE>
<LINE>a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I</LINE>
<LINE>never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and</LINE>
<LINE>Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his</LINE>
<LINE>robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way</LINE>
<LINE>given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath</LINE>
<LINE>should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but</LINE>
<LINE>thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but</LINE>
<LINE>for the light in thy face, the son of utter</LINE>
<LINE>darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the</LINE>
<LINE>night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,</LINE>
<LINE>there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a</LINE>
<LINE>perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and</LINE>
<LINE>torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt</LINE>
<LINE>tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap</LINE>
<LINE>at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have</LINE>
<LINE>maintained that salamander of yours with fire any</LINE>
<LINE>time this two and thirty years; God reward me for</LINE>

<LINE>How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired</LINE>
<LINE>yet who picked my pocket?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you</LINE>
<LINE>think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,</LINE>
<LINE>I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy</LINE>
<LINE>by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair</LINE>
<LINE>was never lost in my house before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many</LINE>
<LINE>a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go</LINE>
<LINE>to, you are a woman, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never</LINE>
<LINE>called so in mine own house before.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, I know you well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know</LINE>
<LINE>you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now</LINE>
<LINE>you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought</LINE>
<LINE>you a dozen of shirts to your back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to</LINE>
<LINE>bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight</LINE>
<LINE>shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir</LINE>
<LINE>John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent</LINE>
<LINE>you, four and twenty pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had his part of it; let him pay.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?</LINE>
<LINE>let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:</LINE>
<LINE>Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker</LINE>
<LINE>of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I</LINE>
<LINE>shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a</LINE>
<LINE>seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not</LINE>
<LINE>how oft, that ring was copper!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an</LINE>
<LINE>he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he</LINE>
<LINE>would say so.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF

<LINE>How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</LINE>

<LINE>Good my lord, hear me.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What didst thou lose, Jack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of</LINE>
<LINE>forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your</LINE>
<LINE>grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely</LINE>
<LINE>of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said</LINE>
<LINE>he would cudgel you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! he did not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed</LINE>
<LINE>prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn</LINE>
<LINE>fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the</LINE>
<LINE>deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,</LINE>
<LINE>go</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what thing? what thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou</LINE>
<LINE>shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,</LINE>
<LINE>setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to</LINE>
<LINE>call me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say</LINE>
<LINE>otherwise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What beast! why, an otter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not</LINE>
<LINE>where to have her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any</LINE>
<LINE>man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you</LINE>
<LINE>ought him a thousand pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Did I, Bardolph?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:</LINE>
<LINE>but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the</LINE>
<LINE>roaring of a lion's whelp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why not as the lion?</LINE>

<LINE>The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</LINE>
<LINE>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</LINE>
<LINE>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</LINE>
<LINE>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</LINE>
<LINE>woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</LINE>
<LINE>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</LINE>
<LINE>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</LINE>
<LINE>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</LINE>
<LINE>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</LINE>
<LINE>were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</LINE>
<LINE>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</LINE>
<LINE>not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of</LINE>
<LINE>innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I</LINE>
<LINE>have more flesh than another man, and therefore more</LINE>
<LINE>frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth</LINE>
<LINE>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>Such attribution should the Douglas have,</LINE>
<LINE>As not a soldier of this season's stamp</LINE>
<LINE>Should go so general current through the world.</LINE>
<LINE>By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy</LINE>
<LINE>The tongues of soothers; but a braver place</LINE>
<LINE>In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.</LINE>

<LINE>Do so, and 'tis well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger with letters</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These letters come from your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Letters from him! why comes he not himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick</LINE>
<LINE>In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?</LINE>
<LINE>Under whose government come they along?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;</LINE>
<LINE>And at the time of my departure thence</LINE>
<LINE>He was much fear'd by his physicians.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would the state of time had first been whole</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he by sickness had been visited:</LINE>
<LINE>His health was never better worth than now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect</LINE>
<LINE>The very life-blood of our enterprise;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</LINE>
<LINE>He writes me here, that inward sickness--</LINE>
<LINE>And that his friends by deputation could not</LINE>
<LINE>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</LINE>
<LINE>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</LINE>
<LINE>On any soul removed but on his own.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,</LINE>
<LINE>That with our small conjunction we should on,</LINE>
<LINE>To see how fortune is disposed to us;</LINE>
<LINE>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.</LINE>
<LINE>Because the king is certainly possess'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your father's sickness is a maim to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</LINE>
<LINE>Seems more than we shall find it: were it good</LINE>
<LINE>To set the exact wealth of all our states</LINE>
<LINE>All at one cast? to set so rich a main</LINE>
<LINE>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</LINE>
<LINE>It were not good; for therein should we read</LINE>
<LINE>The very bottom and the soul of hope,</LINE>
<LINE>The very list, the very utmost bound</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, and so we should;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now remains a sweet reversion:</LINE>
<LINE>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</LINE>
<LINE>Is to come in:</LINE>
<LINE>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.</LINE>
<LINE>If that the devil and mischance look big</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But yet I would your father had been here.</LINE>
<LINE>The quality and hair of our attempt</LINE>
<LINE>Brooks no division: it will be thought</LINE>
<LINE>By some, that know not why he is away,</LINE>
<LINE>That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike</LINE>
<LINE>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:</LINE>
<LINE>And think how such an apprehension</LINE>
<LINE>May turn the tide of fearful faction</LINE>
<LINE>And breed a kind of question in our cause;</LINE>
<LINE>For well you know we of the offering side</LINE>
<LINE>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</LINE>
<LINE>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</LINE>
<LINE>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</LINE>
<LINE>This absence of your father's draws a curtain,</LINE>
<LINE>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</LINE>
<LINE>Before not dreamt of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You strain too far.</LINE>
<LINE>I rather of his absence make this use:</LINE>
<LINE>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</LINE>
<LINE>If we without his help can make a head</LINE>
<LINE>To push against a kingdom, with his help</LINE>
<LINE>We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</LINE>

<LINE>Or hitherwards intended speedily,</LINE>
<LINE>With strong and mighty preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,</LINE>

<LINE>And bid it pass?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>As full of spirit as the month of May,</LINE>
<LINE>And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;</LINE>
<LINE>Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,</LINE>
<LINE>His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd</LINE>
<LINE>Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,</LINE>
<LINE>And vaulted with such ease into his seat,</LINE>
<LINE>As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,</LINE>

<LINE>And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war</LINE>
<LINE>All hot and bleeding will we offer them:</LINE>
<LINE>The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit</LINE>
<LINE>Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire</LINE>

<LINE>If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused</LINE>
<LINE>gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.</LINE>
<LINE>I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty</LINE>
<LINE>soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me</LINE>
<LINE>none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire</LINE>
<LINE>me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked</LINE>
<LINE>twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as</LINE>
<LINE>fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck</LINE>
<LINE>fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such</LINE>
<LINE>toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no</LINE>
<LINE>bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out</LINE>
<LINE>their services; and now my whole charge consists of</LINE>
<LINE>ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of</LINE>
<LINE>companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the</LINE>
<LINE>painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his</LINE>
<LINE>sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but</LINE>
<LINE>discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to</LINE>
<LINE>younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers</LINE>
<LINE>trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a</LINE>
<LINE>long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than</LINE>
<LINE>an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up</LINE>
<LINE>the rooms of them that have bought out their</LINE>
<LINE>services, that you would think that I had a hundred</LINE>
<LINE>and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from</LINE>
<LINE>swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad</LINE>
<LINE>fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded</LINE>
<LINE>all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye</LINE>
<LINE>hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through</LINE>
<LINE>Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the</LINE>
<LINE>villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had</LINE>
<LINE>gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of</LINE>
<LINE>prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my</LINE>
<LINE>company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked</LINE>
<LINE>together and thrown over the shoulders like an</LINE>
<LINE>herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say</LINE>
<LINE>the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or</LINE>
<LINE>the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The trumpet sounds a parley</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I come with gracious offers from the king,</LINE>
<LINE>if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</LINE>
<LINE>You were of our determination!</LINE>
<LINE>Some of us love you well; and even those some</LINE>
<LINE>Envy your great deservings and good name,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you are not of our quality,</LINE>
<LINE>But stand against us like an enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And God defend but still I should stand so,</LINE>
<LINE>So long as out of limit and true rule</LINE>
<LINE>You stand against anointed majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>But to my charge. The king hath sent to know</LINE>
<LINE>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</LINE>
<LINE>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</LINE>
<LINE>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</LINE>
<LINE>Audacious cruelty. If that the king</LINE>
<LINE>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</LINE>
<LINE>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have your desires with interest</LINE>
<LINE>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</LINE>
<LINE>Herein misled by your suggestion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is kind; and well we know the king</LINE>
<LINE>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</LINE>
<LINE>My father and my uncle and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</LINE>
<LINE>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</LINE>
<LINE>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</LINE>
<LINE>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</LINE>
<LINE>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</LINE>
<LINE>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</LINE>
<LINE>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</LINE>
<LINE>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</LINE>
<LINE>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</LINE>
<LINE>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</LINE>
<LINE>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</LINE>
<LINE>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</LINE>
<LINE>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</LINE>
<LINE>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Steps me a little higher than his vow</LINE>
<LINE>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</LINE>
<LINE>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</LINE>
<LINE>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</LINE>
<LINE>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</LINE>
<LINE>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</LINE>
<LINE>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</LINE>
<LINE>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the favourites that the absent king</LINE>
<LINE>In deputation left behind him here,</LINE>
<LINE>When he was personal in the Irish war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I came not to hear this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then to the point.</LINE>
<LINE>In short time after, he deposed the king;</LINE>
<LINE>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</LINE>
<LINE>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</LINE>
<LINE>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</LINE>
<LINE>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</LINE>
<LINE>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</LINE>
<LINE>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</LINE>
<LINE>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</LINE>
<LINE>This head of safety; and withal to pry</LINE>
<LINE>Into his title, the which we find</LINE>
<LINE>Too indirect for long continuance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I return this answer to the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd</LINE>
<LINE>Some surety for a safe return again,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the morning early shall my uncle</LINE>
<LINE>Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you would accept of grace and love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief</LINE>
<LINE>With winged haste to the lord marshal;</LINE>
<LINE>This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest</LINE>
<LINE>To whom they are directed. If you knew</LINE>
<LINE>How much they do to import, you would make haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR MICHAEL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I guess their tenor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like enough you do.</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</LINE>
<LINE>Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am truly given to understand,</LINE>
<LINE>The king with mighty and quick-raised power</LINE>
<LINE>Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,</LINE>
<LINE>What with the sickness of Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose power was in the first proportion,</LINE>
<LINE>And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with them was a rated sinew too</LINE>
<LINE>And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,</LINE>
<LINE>I fear the power of Percy is too weak</LINE>
<LINE>To wage an instant trial with the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR MICHAEL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, my good lord, you need not fear;</LINE>
<LINE>There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Mortimer is not there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR MICHAEL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,</LINE>
<LINE>And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head</LINE>
<LINE>Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn</LINE>
<LINE>The special head of all the land together:</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;</LINE>
<LINE>And moe corrivals and dear men</LINE>
<LINE>Of estimation and command in arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR MICHAEL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:</LINE>
<LINE>For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king</LINE>
<LINE>Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath heard of our confederacy,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore make haste. I must go write again</LINE>

<LINE>The southern wind</LINE>
<LINE>Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then with the losers let it sympathize,</LINE>
<LINE>For nothing can seem foul to those that win.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The trumpet sounds</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter WORCESTER and VERNON</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well</LINE>
<LINE>That you and I should meet upon such terms</LINE>
<LINE>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</LINE>
<LINE>And made us doff our easy robes of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:</LINE>
<LINE>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.</LINE>
<LINE>What say you to it? will you again unknit</LINE>
<LINE>This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?</LINE>
<LINE>And move in that obedient orb again</LINE>
<LINE>Where you did give a fair and natural light,</LINE>
<LINE>And be no more an exhaled meteor,</LINE>
<LINE>A prodigy of fear and a portent</LINE>
<LINE>Of broached mischief to the unborn times?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, my liege:</LINE>
<LINE>For mine own part, I could be well content</LINE>
<LINE>To entertain the lag-end of my life</LINE>
<LINE>With quiet hours; for I do protest,</LINE>
<LINE>I have not sought the day of this dislike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>You have not sought it! how comes it, then?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, chewet, peace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</LINE>
<LINE>Of favour from myself and all our house;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</LINE>
<LINE>For you my staff of office did I break</LINE>
<LINE>In Richard's time; and posted day and night</LINE>
<LINE>to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,</LINE>
<LINE>When yet you were in place and in account</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</LINE>
<LINE>It was myself, my brother and his son,</LINE>
<LINE>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</LINE>
<LINE>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</LINE>
<LINE>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</LINE>
<LINE>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</LINE>
<LINE>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</LINE>
<LINE>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</LINE>
<LINE>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</LINE>
<LINE>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</LINE>
<LINE>What with our help, what with the absent king,</LINE>
<LINE>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</LINE>
<LINE>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</LINE>
<LINE>And the contrarious winds that held the king</LINE>
<LINE>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</LINE>
<LINE>That all in England did repute him dead:</LINE>
<LINE>And from this swarm of fair advantages</LINE>
<LINE>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</LINE>
<LINE>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And being fed by us you used us so</LINE>
<LINE>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</LINE>
<LINE>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</LINE>
<LINE>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</LINE>
<LINE>That even our love durst not come near your sight</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</LINE>
<LINE>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</LINE>
<LINE>Out of sight and raise this present head;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</LINE>
<LINE>As you yourself have forged against yourself</LINE>
<LINE>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</LINE>
<LINE>And violation of all faith and troth</LINE>
<LINE>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These things indeed you have articulate,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,</LINE>
<LINE>To face the garment of rebellion</LINE>
<LINE>With some fine colour that may please the eye</LINE>
<LINE>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</LINE>
<LINE>Of hurlyburly innovation:</LINE>
<LINE>And never yet did insurrection want</LINE>
<LINE>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time</LINE>
<LINE>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In both your armies there is many a soul</LINE>
<LINE>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</LINE>
<LINE>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>This present enterprise set off his head,</LINE>
<LINE>I do not think a braver gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</LINE>
<LINE>More daring or more bold, is now alive</LINE>
<LINE>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</LINE>
<LINE>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</LINE>
<LINE>I have a truant been to chivalry;</LINE>
<LINE>And so I hear he doth account me too;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet this before my father's majesty--</LINE>
<LINE>I am content that he shall take the odds</LINE>
<LINE>Of his great name and estimation,</LINE>
<LINE>And will, to save the blood on either side,</LINE>
<LINE>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit considerations infinite</LINE>
<LINE>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,</LINE>
<LINE>We love our people well; even those we love</LINE>
<LINE>That are misled upon your cousin's part;</LINE>
<LINE>And, will they take the offer of our grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Both he and they and you, every man</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:</LINE>
<LINE>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</LINE>
<LINE>What he will do: but if he will not yield,</LINE>
<LINE>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall do their office. So, be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>We will not now be troubled with reply:</LINE>
<LINE>We offer fair; take it advisedly.</LINE>

<LINE>come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or</LINE>
<LINE>an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.</LINE>
<LINE>Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is</LINE>
<LINE>honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what</LINE>
<LINE>is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?</LINE>
<LINE>he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.</LINE>
<LINE>Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,</LINE>
<LINE>to the dead. But will it not live with the living?</LINE>
<LINE>no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore</LINE>

<LINE>Then are we all undone.</LINE>
<LINE>It is not possible, it cannot be,</LINE>

<LINE>To punish this offence in other faults:</LINE>
<LINE>Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,</LINE>

<LINE>Look how we can, or sad or merrily,</LINE>
<LINE>Interpretation will misquote our looks,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,</LINE>
<LINE>For I profess not talking; only this--</LINE>
<LINE>Let each man do his best: and here draw I</LINE>
<LINE>A sword, whose temper I intend to stain</LINE>
<LINE>With the best blood that I can meet withal</LINE>
<LINE>In the adventure of this perilous day.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.</LINE>
<LINE>Sound all the lofty instruments of war,</LINE>
<LINE>And by that music let us all embrace;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is thy name, that in the battle thus</LINE>
<LINE>Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my head?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know then, my name is Douglas;</LINE>
<LINE>And I do haunt thee in the battle thus</LINE>
<LINE>Because some tell me that thou art a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They tell thee true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought</LINE>
<LINE>Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt find a king that will revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Stafford's death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT.
Enter HOTSPUR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,</LINE>
<LINE>never had triumph'd upon a Scot.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:</LINE>
<LINE>A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;</LINE>
<LINE>Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!</LINE>
<LINE>A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:</LINE>
<LINE>Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king hath many marching in his coats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear</LINE>
<LINE>the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.</LINE>
<LINE>Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour</LINE>
<LINE>for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten</LINE>
<LINE>lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I</LINE>
<LINE>need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have</LINE>
<LINE>led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's</LINE>
<LINE>not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and</LINE>
<LINE>they are for the town's end, to beg during life.</LINE>
<LINE>But who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PRINCE HENRY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:</LINE>
<LINE>Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff</LINE>
<LINE>Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>lend me thy sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.</LINE>
<LINE>Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have</LINE>
<LINE>done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>lend me thy sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st</LINE>
<LINE>not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give it to me: what, is it in the case?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a
bottle of sack</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, is it a time to jest and dally now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He throws the bottle at him. Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do</LINE>
<LINE>come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his</LINE>
<LINE>willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like</LINE>
<LINE>not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me</LINE>
<LINE>life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes</LINE>
<LINE>unlooked for, and there's an end.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LANCASTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech your majesty, make up,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do so.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:</LINE>
<LINE>And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,</LINE>
<LINE>Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,</LINE>
<LINE>and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LANCASTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,</LINE>
<LINE>Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:</LINE>
<LINE>Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;</LINE>
<LINE>But now, I do respect thee as my soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point</LINE>
<LINE>With lustier maintenance than I did look for</LINE>
<LINE>Of such an ungrown warrior.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the Douglas, fatal to all those</LINE>
<LINE>That wear those colours on them: what art thou,</LINE>
<LINE>That counterfeit'st the person of a king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart</LINE>
<LINE>So many of his shadows thou hast met</LINE>
<LINE>And not the very king. I have two boys</LINE>
<LINE>Seek Percy and thyself about the field:</LINE>
<LINE>But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,</LINE>
<LINE>I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear thou art another counterfeit;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:</LINE>
<LINE>But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I win thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE
HENRY enters</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like</LINE>
<LINE>Never to hold it up again! the spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:</LINE>
<LINE>It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Who never promiseth but he means to pay.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They fight: DOUGLAS flies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,</LINE>
<LINE>And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, and breathe awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,</LINE>
<LINE>In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God! they did me too much injury</LINE>
<LINE>That ever said I hearken'd for your death.</LINE>
<LINE>If it were so, I might have let alone</LINE>
<LINE>The insulting hand of Douglas over you,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would have been as speedy in your end</LINE>
<LINE>As all the poisonous potions in the world</LINE>
<LINE>And saved the treacherous labour of your son.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then I see</LINE>
<LINE>A very valiant rebel of the name.</LINE>
<LINE>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</LINE>
<LINE>To share with me in glory any more:</LINE>
<LINE>Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can one England brook a double reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come</LINE>
<LINE>To end the one of us; and would to God</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!</LINE>
<LINE>I better brook the loss of brittle life</LINE>
<LINE>Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;</LINE>
<LINE>They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:</LINE>
<LINE>But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;</LINE>
<LINE>And time, that takes survey of all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the earthy and cold hand of death</LINE>
<LINE>Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust</LINE>
<LINE>And food for--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!</LINE>
<LINE>When that this body did contain a spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>A kingdom for it was too small a bound;</LINE>
<LINE>But now two paces of the vilest earth</LINE>
<LINE>Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead</LINE>
<LINE>Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wert sensible of courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>I should not make so dear a show of zeal:</LINE>
<LINE>But let my favours hide thy mangled face;</LINE>
<LINE>And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself</LINE>
<LINE>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,</LINE>
<LINE>But not remember'd in thy epitaph!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh</LINE>
<LINE>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>I could have better spared a better man:</LINE>
<LINE>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>If I were much in love with vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.</LINE>
<LINE>Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:</LINE>
<LINE>Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Rising up</STAGEDIR>  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,</LINE>

<LINE>to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or</LINE>
<LINE>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.</LINE>
<LINE>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,</LINE>
<LINE>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the</LINE>
<LINE>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:</LINE>
<LINE>but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby</LINE>
<LINE>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and</LINE>
<LINE>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of</LINE>
<LINE>valour is discretion; in the which better part I</LINE>
<LINE>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this</LINE>
<LINE>gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he</LINE>
<LINE>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am</LINE>
<LINE>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I</LINE>
<LINE>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, sirrah,</LINE>

<LINE>But, soft! whom have we here?</LINE>
<LINE>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did; I saw him dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art</LINE>
<LINE>thou alive?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I</LINE>
<LINE>be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Throwing the body down</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let</LINE>
<LINE>him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either</LINE>
<LINE>earl or duke, I can assure you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to</LINE>
<LINE>lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;</LINE>
<LINE>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and</LINE>
<LINE>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be</LINE>
<LINE>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward</LINE>
<LINE>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take</LINE>
<LINE>it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the</LINE>
<LINE>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,</LINE>
<LINE>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.</LINE>
