U-P2P allows for searches on resource meta-data based on the specific type of resource being shared (determined by the currently active community).

= Searching for a Resource =
To search for a resource follow these steps:
# Navigate to the community which defines the type of resource you wish to search for. The currently active community is highlighted in the community selection bar (top of the screen). Alternatively, click on the "More" link in the top right of the screen will display a drop box of all subscribed communities with the active community highlighted. Select a community by clicking on the respective link in the drop down menu.
# Navigate to the Search page for your chosen community by clicking the tab in the top left of the screen.
# The search page for the community should provide a number of fields, each of which searches on a different component of the resource meta-data. For example, a community for sharing eBooks might provide fields to search by title, author, publisher or publishing date. If the community author did not explicitly provide a search page U-P2P will dynamically generate a search page based on the community resource schema. Fields left blank are not considered by the search, and if multiple fields are filled out the resulting resources must fulfil all of the search criteria (search terms are logically AND'ed together). Entering a single * in any field indicates that the field should match all resources (i.e. a single "*" in the title field will return all resources in the community). Note that searching for * is a special "show all" search, and wild cards / regular expressions are not generally supported.
# Launch the search by clicking the provided submit button, and you will be redirected to the search results page (see the [[Search Results and Trust Metrics (U-P2P Help)|Search Results and Trust Metrics]] article for more information.</content></article>
