In order to share a new type of data on the UP2P network you must create or join a "community" which describes the data type. The community definition includes properties describing the data type to be shared, as well as properties of the community itself (such as a description, category, tags, etc.). The community definition contains an XML schema that the data type's meta-data must match, as well as XSLT and CSS stylesheets, HTML pages, and any other arbitrary attachments which are needed to process, search for, and display the community's resources.

{{file:comm_ex_diagram.png|U-P2P communities and share define a specific type of resource. Resources can have any number of arbitrary attachments.}}

= Finding and Joining a Community =
To view all communities shared on your network follow these steps:
* Navigate to the U-P2P Root Community. This can be done by selecting Root Community from the community selection bar, or by clicking on the U-P2P logo in the top left of the screen (which will always navigate to the "View Local Resources" page of the Root Community.
* Navigate to the Search activity (using the activity selection tabs in the top left of the screen), and search for all available communities by running a search for * on the "Title" attribute (this can also be accomplished by clicking the provided link on the Root Community local resources page). Note that a search for * is a special search for all resources, and wild cards and regular expressions are not generally supported.
* Once the search is launched you will be redirected to the search results page. Search results will asynchronously appear on this page as results are retrieved from the network and the local repository. Joining a community in U-P2P is simply the act of downloading the community definition. Subscribe to your desired communities by using the provided link or the built in batch downloader (see the [[Search Results and Trust Metrics (U-P2P Help)|Search Results and Trust Metrics]] article for more information).

= Creating a Community =
Once you're familiar with U-P2P you may want to create your own community for sharing resources. Creating a community requires you to create an XML schema (a process which can be aided by the included [[http://inm-04.sce.carleton.ca:8080/up2p/schemaTool.jsp|SchemaTool]]), as well as (optionally) a set of style sheets and HTML pages which define how your resources should be processed and rendered. If these pages are not provided U-P2P will dynamically generate the appropriate community assets. For a reference on the format of the community assets please see the [[http://inm-04.sce.carleton.ca:8080/up2p/up2p-comm-guide.pdf|Community Creation Reference]], and for a step by step tutorial on how to add a community to U-P2P please see the [[http://inm-04.sce.carleton.ca:8080/up2p/up2p-user-guide.pdf|U-P2P User's Guide]].</content></article>
