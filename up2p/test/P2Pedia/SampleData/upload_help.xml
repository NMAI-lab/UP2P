U-P2P resources are stored as XML files with associated attachments. Once these XML files are generated they can be easily reused by using the direct resource upload feature to bypass the Create system of a community. Resources can also be generated by third party tools, and batch uploads are supported so that new communities can be quickly populated.

= Using the Direct Upload Form =
To access the direct upload form follow these steps:
# Navigate to the community which defines the type of resource you want to upload. The currently active community is highlighted in the community selection bar (top of the screen). Alternatively, click on the "More" link in the top right of the screen will display a drop box of all subscribed communities with the active community highlighted. Select a community by clicking on the respective link in the drop down menu.
# Navigate to the Create page for your chosen community by clicking the tab in the top left of the screen.
# Click on the "Click Here to Upload an Existing Resource" link at the top of the Create page (above the community's provided creation widget). This will open the direct resource upload form.
# Use the provided file browsing dialogue to locate the XML file you wish to upload. If the resource has any attachments, remember to use the "Add an Attachment" button to locate and add the associated attachments as well. U-P2P will display a warning notification if it detects a missing attachment upon upload. **WARNING:** If you forget to include required attachments the resource will still be uploaded and shared, but any links to resource attachments will be unavailable.
# Click the "Upload" button to complete the process. At this point U-P2P will process the resource and redirect you to the viewing page for your new resource. Note that U-P2P validates the resource XML against the community schema, and the upload will fail if the resource does not match the required schema.

= Batch Uploads =
U-P2P supports batch XML files to help quickly populate communities. These batch files must have the following format:
* The document must contain a single root node. The name of the root node is unimportant (however, &lt;batch&gt; is recommended).
* Every child of the root node must be the root node of a complete XML definition of a community resource.

To flag an upload as a batch upload check the "Batch Upload" check box in the direct upload form. Make sure to include all attachments required by any resources in the batch file. When U-P2P processes the batch file it will automatically separate the XML batch file into separate XML files for each resource, and the attachments associated with each resource will be properly moved and associated with their respective resources. U-P2P will display notifications for the number of batch resources detected, the number of resources successfully uploaded, and any required attachments which were not detected.</content></article>
