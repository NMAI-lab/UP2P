<p>Welcome to U-P2P! Universal Peer-to-Peer is a framework for sharing files
and discovering new communities in a peer-to-peer network.</p>

<p>To get started with U-P2P, consult the Universal Peer-to-Peer User's
Guide.</p>

<p>To jump right in, launch U-P2P by running the <code>startup</code>
script in the Apache Tomcat <code>Bin</code> directory and open a web browser to <a
href="http://localhost:8080/up2p"><code>http://localhost:8080/up2p</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Project Contents</h3>
<p>There are two distributions of U-P2P. One is a binary release with Tomcat
and the other is a source release with source code for U-P2P. This file covers
both releases.</p>

<p>Each distribution contains the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>LICENSE - the General Public License version 2, applicable to U-P2P
<li>x.LICENSE - licenses for other software used in this project
<li>readme.html - this file
</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation is available in the "docs' subdirectory of the source distribution, or in the root of the binary distribution.
<p>Consult the <b>Universal Peer-to-Peer User's Guide</b> for information on
getting started with U-P2P.</p>

<p>The documentation is in Adobe PDF<sup>&reg;</sup> format and you may need
the latest <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"
title="Download the Adobe Acrobat Reader">free reader</a> from Adobe.</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>If you've downloaded the binary release and want to take a peek at the
source code, head over to the <a
href="http://u-p2p.sourceforge.net">U-P2P home page</a> or SourceForge
and grab it.</p>
<p>The source code is also available from an SVN repository.</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>The source code and binary forms of the files and resources for
the U-P2P project are made available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public
License (GPL)</a> found in the LICENSE file in the root directory.</p>

including: <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Jakarta Tomcat</a>,
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">Apache Log4j</a>,

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>The following issues are known to occur in U-P2P:</p>
<ul>
<li>When removing resources from a community a refresh of the page may be required for changes to appear.
<li>Deleting a community without deleting all its contained resources beforehand can cause errors if the community is recreated on the same node. This is due to a caching issue, and can be fixed by restarting the U-P2P node.
<li>Shutting down Tomcat is sometimes (always!) prevented by a running instance of U-P2P.
Although Tomcat may claim that it has shutdown, it is still resident in memory. This prevents U-P2P from initializing properly if it is restarted. Workaround: After running the shutdown script, manually kill Tomcat's java process.
