We define an object-based information exchange model and a corresponding query language that we believe are well suited for integration of diverse information sources. We describe how the model and language have been used to integrate heterogeneous bibliographic information sources. We also describe two general-purpose libraries we have implemented for object exchange between clients and servers}

However, some P2P algorithms are sensitive to the network and traffic models that are used in the simulations.  In order to produce realistic results, we therefore require simultations that resemble real-world P2P networks as closely as possible.  We describe the Query Cycle Simulator, a simulator for file-sharing P2P networks.  We link the Query-Cycle Simulator to measurements on existing P2P networks and discuss open issues in simulating these networks.  }

Abstract = {There has recently been an upsurge of interest in the possibilities of combining structured data and ad-hoc information retrieval from traditional hypertext. In this experiment, we run queries extracted from a query log of a major search engine against the Semantic Web to discover if the Semantic Web has anything of interest to the average user. We show that there is indeed much information on the Semantic Web that could be relevant for many queries for people, places and even abstract concepts, although they are overwhelmingly clustered around a Semantic Web-enabled export of Wikipedia known as DBPedia. to a more specialized search engine. We use a search query log of approximately 15 million distinct queries from Microsoft Live Search. This query log contains 14,921,285 queries. Of these queries, 7,095,302 (47.55\%) were unique, and corrected for capitalization, 6,623,635 (44.39\%) were unique.},

In this note, we propose the construction of a storage medium with similar properties. The basic idea is to use redundancy and scattering techniques to replicate data across a large set of machines (such as the Internet), and add anonymity mechanisms to drive up the cost of selective service denial attacks. The detailed design of this service is an interesting scientific problem, and is not merely academic: the service may be vital in safeguarding individual rights against new threats posed by the spread of electronic publishing. 1 The Gutenberg Inheritance In medieval times, knowledge was guarded for the power it gave.

@article{zhang06-emergent,
	abstract = {Defining and using ontology to annotate web resources with semantic markups is generally perceived as the primary way to implement the vision of the Semantic Web. The ontology provides a shared and machine understandable semantics for web resources that agents and applications can utilize. This top-down approach (in the sense that an ontology is defined first on top of existing web resources and then used later to markup them), however, has a high barrier to entry and is difficult to scale up. In this paper, we investigate using a bottom-up approach for semantically annotating web resources as supported by the now widely popular social bookmarks services on the web where users can annotate and categorize web resources using ``tags" freely choosen by the user without any pre-existing global semantic model. This kind of informal social categories is coined as ``folksonomies". We show how global semantics can be statistically inferred from the folksonomies to semantically annotate the web resources. The global semantic model also disambiguate the tags and group synonymous tags together. Finally, we show that there indeed are hierarchical relations among the emerged concepts in the folksonomy and it is plausible to further identify them if we use more advanced probabilistic models.},

	abstract = {Wikis are established means for the collaborative authoring, versioning and publishing of textual articles. The Wikipedia project, for example, succeeded in creating the by far largest encyclopedia just on the basis of a wiki. Recently, several approaches have been proposed on how to extend wikis to allow the creation of structured and semantically enriched content. However, the means for creating semantically enriched structured content are already available and are, although unconsciously, even used by Wikipedia authors. In this article, we present a method for revealing this structured content by extracting information from template instances. We suggest ways to efficiently query the vast amount of extracted information (e.g. more than 8 million RDF statements for the English Wikipedia version alone), leading to astonishing query answering possibilities (such as for the title question). We analyze the quality of the extracted content, and propose strategies for quality improvements with just minor modifications of the wiki systems being currently used.}

@article{guy2006,
	abstract = {1. Introduction A folksonomy is a type of distributed classification system. It is usually created by a group of individuals, typically the resource users. Users add tags to online items, such as images, videos, bookmarks and text. These tags are then shared and sometimes refined. A general review of social bookmarking tools, one popular use area of folksonomies, was given in the April edition of D-Lib [1]. In the article the authors elaborate on the approach taken by social classification systems and the motivators behind tagging. They write, "...tags are just one kind of metadata and are not a replacement for formal classification systems such as Dublin Core, MODS, etc.... Rather, they are a supplemental means to organise information and order search results." In this article we look at what makes folksonomies work. We agree with the premise that tags are no replacement for formal systems, but we see this as being the core quality that makes folksonomy tagging so useful. We begin by looking at the issue of "sloppy tags", a problem to which critics of folksonomies are keen to allude, and ask if there are ways the folksonomy community could offset such problems and create systems that are conducive to searching, sorting and classifying. We then go on to question this "tidying up" approach and its underlying assumptions, highlighting issues surrounding removal of low-quality, redundant or nonsense metadata, and the potential risks of tidying too neatly and thereby losing the very openness that has made folksonomies so popular.},

  abstract = {While the Semantic Web requires a large amount of structured knowledge (triples) to allow machine reasoning, the acquisition of this knowledge still represents an open issue. Indeed, expressing expert knowledge in a given formalism is a tedious process. Less structured annotations such as tagging have, however, proved immensely popular, whilst existing unstructured or semi-structured collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have proven to be useful and scalable. Both processes are often regulated through social mechanisms such as wiki-like operations, recommendations, ratings, and collaborative games. To promote collaborative tagging as a means to acquire unstructured as well as structured knowledge we introduce the notion of Extreme Tagging, which describes systems which allow the tagging of resources, as well as of tags themselves and their relations. We provide a formal description of extreme tagging followed by examples and highlight the necessity of regulatory processes which can be applied to it. We also present a prototype implementation.}

This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis and simulations show that Chord is scalable: Communication cost and the state maintained by each node scale logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

 @Article{LSIR-gridvine,
   abstract    = {GridVine is a semantic overlay infrastructure based on a
                 peer-to-peer (P2P) access structure. Built following the
                 principle of data independence, it separates a logical
                 layer -- in which data, schemas, and schema mappings are
                 managed -- from a physical layer consisting of a
                 structured P2P network supporting decentralized indexing,
                 key load-balancing, and efficient routing. The system is
                 decentralized, yet fosters semantic interoperability
                 through pair-wise schema mappings and query
                 reformulation. GridVine's heterogeneous but semantically
                 related information sources can be queried transparently
                 using iterative query reformulation. The authors discuss
                 a reference implementation of the system and several
                 mechanisms for resolving queries collaboratively.},

  abstract = {A web of linked RDF data may be enabled by standards specifying how links should be made in RDF and under what conditions they should be followed as well as powerful generic RDF browsers that can traverse an open web of RDF resources. The Tabulator is an RDF browser, which is designed both for new users to provoke interest in the Semantic Web and give them a means to access and interact with the entire web of RDF data, and for developers of RDF content to provide incentive for them to post their data in RDF, to refine and promote RDF linking standards, and to let providers see how their data interacts with the rest of the Semantic Web. A challenge for Semantic Web browsers is to bring the power of domain-specific applications to a generic program when new unexpected domains can be encountered in real time. The Tabulator project is an attempt to demonstrate and utilize the power of linked RDF data with a user-friendly Semantic Web browser that is able to recognize and follow RDF links to other RDF resources based on the users exploration and analysis.}

@TECHREPORT{rfc3986,
AUTHOR={T. Berners-Lee and R. Fielding and L. Masinter},
TITLE={Uniform Resource Identifier {(URI):} Generic Syntax},
TYPE={RFC},
INSTITUTION={Internet Engineering Task Force},
NUMBER={3986},
MONTH={jan},
YEAR={2005},
ABSTRACT={A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource. This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines
a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation
to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the
scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This
specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is
performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.},

@TECHREPORT{rfc1321,
AUTHOR={R. Rivest},
TITLE={The {MD5} {Message-Digest} Algorithm},
TYPE={RFC},
INSTITUTION={Internet Engineering Task Force},
NUMBER={1321},
PAGES={21},
DAYS={15},
MONTH={apr},
YEAR={1992},
ABSTRACT={This document describes the MD5 message-digest algorithm. The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit ``fingerprint'' or ``message digest of the input. It is
conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two
messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message
having a given prespecified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is
intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be
``compressed'' in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private
(secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. The MD5
algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines. In addition,
the MD5 algorithm does not require any large substitution tables; the
algorithm can be coded quite compactly. The MD5 algorithm is an
extension of the MD4 message-digest algorithm. MD5 is slightly slower
than MD4, but is more ``conservative'' in design. MD5 was designed
because it was felt that MD4 was perhaps being adopted for use more
quickly than justified by the existing critical review; because MD4 was
designed to be exceptionally fast, it is ``at the edge'' in terms of
risking successful cryptanalytic attack. MD5 backs off a bit, giving up
a little in speed for a much greater likelihood of ultimate security. It
incorporates some suggestions made by various reviewers, and contains
additional optimizations. The MD5 algorithm is being placed in the
public domain for review and possible adoption as a standard.},
